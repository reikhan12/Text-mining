depression,doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2366,2019-10-29 15:52:02,177,1.0,SQLwitch
depression,1frqlk0,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",26,2024-09-29 01:05:43,202,1.0,SQLwitch

depression,1iehg7t,Life is a Prison,"I don't see any other way to put it.  Life is a prison in that even when I'm ready to die, some people want to shove life down my throat like it's mandatory to live.  I'm sick of being made to feel obligated.  I'm sick of being made to feel like no matter what, I'm fucking stuck like chuck living on earth.  I'm sick of the threats of being locked up.  It's not to protect me from myself.  It's so that other people can feel warm and fuzzy that I'm still here.  I get called selfish for wanting to go.  Selfish is the other way around.  Selfish is guilt tripping and manipulating someone who doesn't want to live anymore into sticking around just so others can sleep easy at night.  It's all bullshit.  Death is inevitable.  Every living creature on this earth WILL expire.  What's the difference between going sooner rather than later if the end result is still the same?  It makes no difference.  I'd rather go while I'm at least still fairly young.  I'm in my 40's.  That's long enough to live.  I sure as shit don't want to wait for the aging process to progress and do me in from any combination of age related disease.  Nope.  Instead I'll hear shit like ""Jesus loves you.""  ""Don't do that to Jesus.""  ""Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.""  This one drives me apeshit.  Major Depressive Disorder is fucking permanent.  I've been in a depressive episode that has dragged on for almost ten years now.  That's not so temporary.  I don't want medication.  I want my death.  I'm ready for my permanent vacation in pure non existence.  No more bullshit taxes.  No more bullshit jobs or stupid useless bullshit bosses who walk around with a raging boner for controlling others.  No more bullshit mortgage, other bills, or buying bullshit groceries when prices are fucking sky high.  Shit isn't getting any cheaper.  Prices will keep going up.

depression,1ieotlb,I really don’t think I am going to last much longer,"Why is it that most people seem to be able to go through life successfully and happy? I’m 36, and I just feel like a failure and incapable of doing the “normal” things. I’ve been told my entire life that I’d find what it is that I’m supposed to do in this journey. Everything I have ever loved or done well does not fit into any market that would help me live a sustainable life. I tried, and I tried hard. I burnt out and now I don’t even do those things for my own enjoyment. Dopamine and serotonin feels nonexistent.

I’ve lost my love for people, as I’ve been done so dirty so many times. I’ve tried to always go out of my way and make others feel loved, but have often been met with adverse reactions and no reciprocation. 

I’ve fallen in hard times, can’t find a fulfilling job, had to move back with my parents.. I’ve tried the medications, the therapy, the holistic approach, everything under the sun. Im trying to study something new and reach for a new goal, but im not in love with it and cannot bring myself to be disciplined enough to follow through and finish what I started. 

I truly cannot allow myself to just leave, because if I caused my family to hurt like I do now over a decision of giving up, that just hurts more to think about. I put myself in their shoes and know I just would not be able to hang. But for far too long, I’ve been drowning. I’m beginning to feel physically and mentally unable to move past this. As I lay here in bed for another consecutive afternoon contemplating whether or not it’s worth it to stay, I really just know I do not want to be here anymore. I don’t have hope for the future. I’m pissed, depressed and at this point am already dead inside.

depression,1iej36v,"I can’t play videogames, they even give me suicide thoughts.","This problem appeared a few years ago, when videogames basically gave me no fun anymore. It escalated in the worst. If I think about videogames I start feeling apathetic and I can’t basically even think about them anymore. I love videogames, they can be a great way to escape reality, but I can’t play them for no actual reason, i’m just starting to feel worse. I look at my friends and a lot of other people that finished the games I want to play, but if I even manage to start playing something I won’t play it for more than a hour, spending more time is just killing me and I feel myself different from these people, because they can do thing I wan’t to do, but can’t.

I thought that may be because i’m afraid that i’m going to be unable to see EVERYTHING in game, like in baldurs gate 3, there is 17.000 endings which are not really different, but still a bit different, and the fact I psychically can’t see them all terrifies me and give me apathy. I also thought that may be because i’m afraid i’ll not be able to finish the game that I started so my body thinks it’s better to not even try.

I thought there can be a few more reasons actually, like maybe my body understands that playing videogames means using your arms to control everything, brain to think about stuff and thoughts about actions, like actually “playing” the game makes me apathetic. 
It can also be because i’m scared that I would not be able to complete every single game I wan’t and physically can’t complete every single game ever and it terrifies me too. 

I don’t know what can be the actual reason of this, but that all my assumptions. I would like to know if anyone was in the same situation and what have helped you. I really wan’t to play videogames like I did in my childhood, spending whole day playing videogames, I wan’t to escape that reality, don’t feel even worse because of it. I wan’t to be that guy that have finished a lot of different and interesting games. I just wan’t to be like everyone else =(
Every that thought and the fact I basically can’t play videogames at all makes me think about suicide even more

Again, if someone was in the same situation I would be grateful if you share with me and how do you managed to get through this! 

P.S.: sorry for my terrible English, thats not my first language, but I hope everything is still readable and you could understand what I have said. 

Edit: Also, it doesn’t appear to be a problem with specific games, it appears to be a problem with every single game, even easy ones where you don’t need to think and do much. So if you wan’t to recommend me playing short, easy games, i’m afraid that would not work.

Edit 2: I have also remembered that i’m not feeling myself that exact way always, sometimes I can think about videogames and the reason why i’m not feeling worse is because I tell myself, that i’m not supposed to complete everything in the world and there is literally no sense in completing every single game ever, even completing every single game I wan’t, because every life and gaming experience is different for everyone and if there is a reincarnation I could finish these games that I couldn’t finish in previous lives, so it makes me feel easier, but in fact I still can’t actually play games, and if I manage to do i’ll still feel worse, but I can think about them sometimes. I thought that maybe this problem may go away someday in the future and everything I can do now is just accept everything and not be afraid of losing something in my life, because I will always (if reincarnation exists) be able to do everything I couldn’t in this life in my next.

depression,1iege3q,For my whole life I have never seen meaning in life and I can't fix it.,"Hi! I'm 20 (F) and I don't feel life is worth any effort. The matter is, I have never felt like it did. Since I was a kid I was more introverted and socially isolated (as a choice). Making friends and keeping them was like a chore, and so was doing anything that was not the bare minimum. Always kept good grades with no effort, because that was the standard at home, but never did anything beyond what I considered necessary. I was never able to keep hobbies, and always ended up choosing the activity that demanded the least of me physically and mentally. The only thing I remained consistent with is my love for philosophy, but not enough for any kind for  commitment to it. At 11/12 I would ask God to give my parents another kid and terminate my life. Keep in mind I don't have any trauma and my family is normal. They are well off financially so I am very privileged and never had to work. But I can just say that I did not want to keep living, no reason behind it. After I stopped believing in God (unrelated reasons, a lot of philosophical stuff) I still did not see the appeal in living, but kept on because life was not bad, it was just pointless.
Now, I'm 20 and 2 years from finishing college. I have reached a point where I NEED to want to live, because otherwise nothing is worth it and I won't be able to do anything. But I don't feel life is worth the effort of studying, getting expertise in some area, getting a job, going through anxiety and stress and engaging in adult responsibilities. I feel I have only lived up until now because it was relatively easy. 
The only thing I had to deal with was mental illness but I had a roof over my head, bills were paid and I did not need to think about my future. I could just ignore my lack of interest in life.
In conclusion, I've been having suicidal thoughts lately, thinking about letters and ways to do it, because I came to understand that I either find the energy to live without relying on others or I'll end up killing myself. 
I feel life a parasite, someone that can't live without clinging on others to have purpose and do the things I have no energy to do. 
I can't seem to find a way to fix it, so here I am looking for any sort of advice. Am I destined to some kind of nihilistic mindset or is there a way to fix this chronic disinterest in life?
Thanks in advance. ",13,2025-01-31 15:47:28,16,1.0,False_Sea_1732

she told me i do in fact have a couple cavities, but one of them is more concerning and i may either need a crown or a root canal, but she’s going to try and save it so i’ll just need a filling instead of all that. she also said my wisdom teeth are growing in sideways and i have to get them removed, which im even more anxious about.

depression,1ier3b0,i think my bf loves his depression more than he loves me,"(F25) ive been with my bf for almost two years and hes been depressed the entire time, its never bothered me and i'm always more than happy to be there for him (at least i try to be). but this time together i think im realizing that his depression is so strong he doesn't even see or notice or even care that im around.

  
he always says no one is ever there for him, he's lonely and he has no friends. i understand its hard to see whats good in your life through the lens of depression but i can't help but think that after nearly two years he still thinks he has nobody. we've been long distance the entire time and im always the one buying flights to see him or getting hotels for him to stay with me. we try to see each other once a month. i always pay for our dates when we're together, which is hard for me because i know he has a more affluent family than i do. im always willing to pay because i want us to enjoy our lives together. he rarely plans dates with me, i always have to plan when I visit bcus he's too depressed at home. he's said some pretty mean things about my body and we've had fights about me not understanding his emotions and experiences while completely ignoring the fact that ive been through trauma too. for the first year all of these things literally didnt bother me cause i can separate who he is but now being together for as long as we have, im starting to take it personally and it really hurts.

  
we have so much fun together, he matches my humour, he's so kind and caring, i love how curious and non-judgemental he is. no matter how mean he's been to me i've always tried to give him grace bcus that is not his character, it's his depression taking over. i know who he is underneath it all and i see what a lovely caring kind funny incredible person he is. he is literally my best friend and i hate that im losing him to depression. 

  
ive helped him through moving across the country, helped him drop out of school because he hated it so much, his mom helped with getting him a job, ive suggested tools ive learned in therapy that have helped him but he chooses not to do even when he knows they help, i found his group therapy he goes to, ive suggested things he can do when his friends are in town, his friends love him and invite him out all the time, he literally gets bj's whenever he wants from me, i pay for everything and soooo much more... i really feel like ive been there for him for two years. why cant he notice me? why doesn't he see me? why is it such a chore for him to love me? 

  
im sorry this is so long winded! im just really at a point where every time i talk about this with him hes soooooo hurt and devastated and he turns it into my fault for keeping it in and resenting him, WHEN I DONT! i dont want to lose him but im not getting the love i deserve. i'm just worried he'll give up on himself... is there something i could say to help him realize i exist or a nice way to break things off? any advice would be great",1,2025-01-31 23:21:00,0,1.0,dummy_idiot_stoopid

depression,1ie8hev,I want to end it all,"I live in Canada, in October 2022 I attempted suicide and stupidly lived because I told my ex and she saw the msg before I passed away.

I hate every moment of my life. I'm never going to be capable of anything. I have major depression and insomnia and I'm a drug addict. I havnt enjoyed any part of my life in almost 2 years since I was together with my ex.  Thinking back at it she treated me like completele trash most of the time and knew exactly how to make me feel worse and I wanted but knew how to make things feel ok in person. 

I can't sleep because of insomnia even with medication and I'm so depressed I can't function or take care of my self. I don't think I ever will. When I was younger my sister suffered from depression too and I watched my parents change slightly from thinking depression is fake to thinking it's real but only getting in the way when trying to help. I'm never going to be able to function at all or take care of my self. I'll never have a social life, friends a girlfriend or anything neither do I want any because they are all fake and shitty people who only want things for them self. 

Even going to the doctor is a waste of time because they don't care or help either. I'm never going to be able to function at all and I'm a laughing stock / joke in my house. I'm never going to enjoy my life or get any pleasure from it. Im 21 now and I just take drugs to try to numb this feeling. I know I'm never going to be able to take care of my self let alone work or progress or enjoy life. For my birthday this year I literally bought a suicide kit for when I want to attempt again but this time no one will know so I will actually pass away.

I'm just waiting my familys time and money. I'll never function or go anywhere with my life at best I get disability (in the process of applying to) and maybe try to enjoy a few things before I kill my self. I havnt enjoyed anything in a very long time it's pointless to try anymore. In never going to be able to be successful, shit I can't even take care of my self. I'll never be able to provide for my self or do a any hobbies I enjoy because I just shut down.

I know I'll be dead soon. Very soon. I'm going to have nothing to show for my life no matter how long I live and I'll always just be dependent on my mother to survive. There's no getting better for me. I can't even get help when I ask medical professionals for it unless I very seriously attempt my life. I don't even know why I'm alive after my last attempt. I consumed enough fentanyl and Xanax to kill a neighborhood.

What should I do to finish up my life before I take it. Collect disability and try to help others in need? Collect it and just go on a big bender. do nothing and over dose instead?

Not a single soul actually cares about me or ever really cared about me and my family just sees me as a rat that will live at home forever and they aren't even wrong. Should I save up my disability and donate it to charity? It's not worth giving a dime to anyone but my sister because she's the only person who ever showed any care about me but she's also just done.

I'm ultimately doing nothing with my life and will do nothing with my life so should I just end it now? How do people live with them self after manipulating you for over a year or several years pretending they love you and you mean something to them but in reality they are just trying to get rid of you the whole time.

No matter what I do I'll never function enough to be able to take care of my self again or work or anything, what's the point of life when all you can do lay in bed thinking about suicide while everyone else go ahead and lives their life. Why would I want to live if my quality of life is so poor I can't even take care of my self, enjoy a day of my own life or any every day tasks like going to the store. I don't trust a soul anymore and nothing is enjoyable. Wtf do I do? Successfully take my life? Go to the ER and get forced on medicine that makes me to manic get stuck in there forever. honestly I've given up for a long time now because I know its impossible for me to have friends, a girlfriend or anything sort of relationship. I'll never be able to hold a job because I only have 2-4 weeks in the year I can actually function. It's embarrassing to exist I'm not even on government support yet and if I get it it's only 1300 a month. Doable for living with my parents but if anything happens I'm just screwed.
I'm screwed anyways I spend my days just thinking about and contemplating suicide. The two reasons I havnt tried again is 1. If I survive I'll probably be partially or fully brain dead and 2. If not my my mother is going to lock me in a place for the mentally insane against my will.

All my old hobbies / things I used to enjoy I don't even tolerate them. If I had infinite money tomorrow and 0 mental health issues I still have no idea what id do. Id probably just take my life still. I don't understand why people live everyday, I used to listen to the people that just say u won't experience the next day but the past 7 years have been basically identical but my mental health, quality of life etc just getting worse. I can't even get a proper psychiatrist for help or anything I'm just done. I can end my life literally any minute I want and I'm shocked I havnt. I know I'll hurt my family for a day or two and then they will forget about me and then literally no one else will rm me.

I have to really don't get why anyone enjoys living. Can someone help explain because no one's ever made any sense last time I probably felt any joy like like 1-2 years ago creating fake memories but now everything is completely unenjoyable and it's impossible to meet a decent human in person.

Sorry for the rent, I thank you if you have any advices  or support to give and I wish everyone the best. <3",1,2025-01-31 22:25:44,3,0.6,AliceTinybox

So my Dr. And I decided to try Lexapro. I didnt like it because it made me have no feelings towards anything or anybody. So I stopped taking them. Been off for 6 months and I can feel how hard the depression is hitting my body.

Today was hard. 
My sil just had her 1st baby. I got my tube's removed with my last baby. It was my choice because I had health complications during my pregnancy. While I was visiting my mil made a comment about me having another baby. Now this isn't the 1st time she's done it. I truly don't think it's done with any bad intentions. I just think she loves her grandchildren so much she would love more lol. I however felt like a failure when she said that. I had to choke back the tears. I feel like because my depression is so bad it's making feel that way. I just needed a place to vent and let my feelings out bc I am so tired of keeping them in and pretending that I'm okay.

depression,1ieow4f,Feel absolutely defeated (venting),"The past months had been leading up to this, but I am still having a hard time dealing with it. I just had to apply for full disability. 

I love my job, my boss, my colleagues, work gives me structure and purpose just for myself. I feel like giving up, like a worthless piece of sh*t. I haven‘t been able to work since May 24, and even before that I was sick half the time for years. I really want to go back to work. 

And it is not just my pride (don’t know if that is the right word). Of course disability does not pay as much as my job, and money is extremely tight. I have been selling some stuff, but that is just a small, temporary relief. Found out yesterday that two of my teeth need a new crown. I can’t pay for this. For anything out of the regular, planned expenses. 

So all of this (and much, much more) triggered my suicidal thoughts again. I am not going to do anything, since that would completely destroy my daughter (11). Bit everyone who knows what they feel like knows how drained I feel, how small and how defeated. I am scheduled for a stay in a psychiatric hospital (been there many times) in February, but probably won’t be able to go. Had a fall with my bike in November, a bone was partially fractured. It is not healing as fast as it should, and the hospital might not admit me unless fully healed.

So the one thing I have coming up that is going to help me will very likely have to wait. I am drowning. Guess I just needed to vent.

depression,1ieope4,I am up shit creek.,"This might be a bit long than the usual posts, pls bear with me. I could simply tell you that I am sex deprived, but being sex deprived imo comes in many different shades, based on my observations. So, I'll tell you everything that's required to know.

A few years ago, I was studying for getting into medschool and that involved a lot of studying for two years. The journey was quite difficult since it was coupled with Covid 19, family illnesses, and I also broke many friendships on the way, because most were becoming toxic. Then, I entered medschool and I loved it, I still do. 

I have made many friends, I am good with everyone (almost everyone), I haven't done anything derogatory to anyone, or been the recepient of anything similar. But since I am that ""charmer"" nobody knows what I feel every single day, EVERY FUCKING DAY. The problem is, although this is a problem, I want it to stay within the four walls of my bedroom. I just don't have any specific reason for it.

I am sharing this because I think this will help me slightly, if not completely cure me of it. And, since it is anonymous, it has dual benefit for me.

So, I haven't had a single girlfriend ever, despite the fact that I have conveyed my feelings to many girls/women (over the years), but been rejected by all. The hippocampus is quite a double-edged sword and it hasn't done good for me either.

When I was in school, a girl once told me, ""Nobody likes you, are you aware of that fact?"". That time I had said, ""I don't need you to make me understand the fact"", but little did I know that it was actually an implication that nobody WILL.

Now years have passed, and I am in medschool. I have tried here too, but failed MISERABLY. I have lost hope that I'm going to find anyone who I'm worth being a boyfriend of, be it a girl belonging to the same profession as me or of a different profession.

And since I'm not that same school-going boy, my demands have raised to having sex. The problem is, who should I be sleeping with, there’s nobody here. Now, this has taken a huge toll on me. It started off as relationship deprivation, to sex deprivation and is now progressing to depression, insomnia and poor academics. It's literally an alarm button which says ""I need sex or I'll die""

School didn't work, neither did college and so I headed where most single guys head towards- Hinge. And good lord, I didn't expect so many women up for hookups. The problem with such apps is that you hardly get anyone who's not up for something like ""fuck and forget"". So, I deleted it.

There's this fact that I'm sex deprived. But at the same time, I don't only want sex. I want someone who will stay with me in a sexual relationship, making sure that the first night spent will not be the last, but also not have sex so much that I'm not able to do things I want to/ have to. 

I can't manage talking this out to parents, nor can I do it with friends (they may be good people, but when shit hits the fan, it hurts). And since I can't do either, I literally can't pay for a psychiatrist/sexologist. People always keep mocking me about how single I am, and this mental illness is affecting my relations, my academics and my sanity. I am frustrated 24/7 every day of the year and people think I'm abusing them. For comparison, I'm like Martin Lawrence in the movie Bad Boys, except he has a partner and I don't. 

I look around and see people who are not even in college, getting action. It's not that I hate medschool, but getting here made me a bastard. I can talk good, and maybe that's why women don't want me, they think I'm a worthless husband material. I haven't been appreciated by any girl, nor by any of my friends. I have hypergnathia which makes me look ugly and lose confidence in public, but that's a minor issue.

I have already had so much solo sex that I have stopped watching porn completely. I feel disgusted by how I am jerking off to someone who literally sold themselves over the internet (no intended offense to the job profile). 

I am not here for any criticism, but if someone has paddled out of this shit creek, can anyone tell me about their experience?",0,2025-01-31 21:39:32,0,0.5,Unfaithful_basterd

‏I have an avoidant attachment style when it it comes to relationships because i have been hurt before and still traumatized

‏I did some mistakes in that relationship with that but only because i was scared of love and getting hurt (not an excuse i know) we got cool but she dont want any involvement with me
‏
i still love her so much and im trying to communicate with her but she moving on day by day and i feel like im totally getting forgotten by her

depression,1ieo5o6,Not all depression can be explained,"I feel like shit most days. On most days I want to just lay in my bed and not eat, drink or sleep. I don't feel shitty because something bad happened, I think terrible thoughts, but they didn't cause it; they are merely a byproduct.

My father had temper issues and is now neglecting my sister, my mom is bpd, nariccisitc, and violent. She tells people I hit her, my bf Beata me, and I'm schizophrenic. I'm not. She cheated on my dad and beat my brother and I. I don't speak to her but know she is mistreating my sister.

I self harm, it's never planned, it's whenever I break down for some reason. I feel this constant infliction to harm myself or put myself in harmful situations. I find myself arguing with my bf, he's becoming apathetic to me.

I have no friends since I moved with him, as he lives far from when I originally lived. He's not abusive or anything, he's just quiet. But I'm lonely.

depression,1ienp1r,is it possible to truly get better without antidepressants?,"I'm not against antidepressants at all, as a concept. i don't think there's any innate merit to 'dealing with depression naturally'. but personally, i just don't enjoy the idea of having to take medication that's not super good for my body for the rest of my life. 

I've been on the same antidepressant for five years now and I hadn't changed the dose since I first started. I'd been trying really hard not to increase it, after doing some research and finding out there was a lot i hadn't been told by my doctor about the medication. recently my mental health got really bad and I decided to increase my dose. its been a month now and I can feel a definite difference, but I dont know how to feel about it. im reminded that im not just sad or lazy, there is a genuine imbalance in my brain. it makes me feel kind of dejected, knowing that real joy or just normality isn't possible at the moment without the pills. it's like with any other illness I guess, realizing that you really are sick and that thinking differently or making lifestyle changes might help but they probably won't fix the problem by themselves. its a hard thing to come to terms with. 

i wonder if one day i won't need them. has anyone reached a point where they can truly see color in life and where just existing doesn't feel like a constant struggle after coming off antidepressants? 

pls no 'you just have to live naturally' etc. i wanna hear from people whose courses of treatment have just organically lead you to a point where you don't need antidepressants anymore.

depression,1iencta,a little rant about being in college with depression and anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I have dysthymia and GAD and the winter months just suck right now, and being in school is just difficult. For a long time I’ve been wanting to become a doctor, since before I graduated high school and it’s my 2.5 year of college. Incapable, unable… those describe how I feel. I can’t balance 3 classes, I’ve been trying and trying, studying minimum 2 hrs everyday but forgot to keep track of my exam days. My first exam is early next week and I only found out this week. Even though I’ve been studying, it’s just hard :(. The anxiety also gives me some pretty big attention deficit (that confused my gp into thinking I have ADHD). So I’m a wonderful little cocktail of mental struggles! I know I’m able to get it together and I’ll find a way, but it’s just hard sometimes.. I just know that I love working with people, especially volunteering with seniors, and it has only made me want to attend med school even more.

Just wanted to get this off my chest before going to study, maybe someone reading this can relate :). And yes, I am on medication and have regular CBT.

depression,1iec669,Hi there,"Hi I'm 29F. I just wanted to share how I feel most of the time. I feel like I want to end my life right now. Most of the time I feel like there's no tomorrow. i had a rough childhood, I was always neglected and didn't have the protective parents, yet I still loved them and became a breadwinner and my parents are now old.

I work early at the age of 15 to feed myself and send money to my family. My three brothers didn't experience the strictness I received before, I was like a puppy that was sent to Manila forced to work because they don't like my ex boyfriend and I might end up being pregnant.

When I was a child, I was sexually harassed by my cousins. I was about 6 years old by that time. I was told to do things I didn't understand before and when I got older, I now understand the violation that they did to me. 

I was cheated before by my long term boyfriend and my husband last year, but we're good now. He seemed changed, I hope so. All this things happened to me, feeling neglected and feeling unimportant made me feel like I shouldn't exist anymore. 

But I'm lucky to have my five dogs, I feel happy around them because they don't judge me by the way I am. Weird but this is how I feel. I get anxiety when I'm around with a lot of people, I shake a lot, I cannot eat my food properly, it feels like there something stuck in my throat everytime I eat outside, but I'm trying to fight it. Trying to live everyday, trying to be normal but most of the time I remember the betrayals, neglection, all the lies. I feel like I don't want to live anymore. 

But I'm trying my best. I no longer cut my wrist, I realized hospital won't accept hmo if the wound is self inflicted. And I don't want to spend money just because I've hurt myself. I also promised to my little self (I talked to my self sometimes, a vision of when I was a child) that I will not hurt her anymore and I wanted her to have a long happy life. But its hard, it's hard to find my purpose other than being a doormat. 

I have friends but I no longer share this things to them, we're getting old and I don't want to be a burden. I don't even need advices. I just want to vent this out of my chest. I'm here sitting in my office chair. I'm currently on sick leave cause of stomach pain on my lower left side. Sometimes I just wish I would die right away.

depression,1iehrzf,My life has always been a constant state of suffering/struggle,"22M here. Sorry for the long post, I just need to note this down somewhere and hope maybe some advice from strangers will make me feel better.

The earliest memory I have of my struggle with life and mental health is when I was 5 yrs old. I first started playing soccer at this age, but I could not for the life of me step onto the field without a parent running beside me as I was playing. I eventually got over this, but I think this is the first indication of my life long struggle with mental illness.

All through out elementary school, middle school and high school my social anxiety was pretty bad. I couldn’t do sleepovers at friend’s houses while in elementary school. I was really scared of talking to girls at this young age too and one of my friends even told me  word for word that he “didn’t want a friend that couldn’t talk to girls”.  In middle school I had two chances of having my first girl friend and totally blew it because I was scared to talk to them. 

Then I think this is where I discovered porn and developed a problem with it. Then high school comes along in my junior year I had a huge crush on a popular girl that never in a million years I would’ve thought she liked me back, but once I found out she did I literally shut down. I tried to talk to her once I was so shaky and blew that chance immediately. 

From this point on I really started experiencing depression and I started to develop anorexia. Although I never got it diagnosed as anorexia, my eating and exercise habits were disordered and I ended up going from ~180-190lbs downs to ~140lbs (I was ~ 6ft tall at the time). I was able to catch myself from this spiral when I went to the doctors for an annual check up and he said I dropped to the 50%-60% percentile for my weight. 

Now college comes around and of course my freshman year is COVID and I was stuck to my dorm room 80% of the year. I was almost at my breaking point and called into my doctor crying and they put my on antidepressants. The rest of my college experience I finally felt somewhat normal, got my first gf and felt calm and content. 

Untillllllll senior year rolls around… I find out one of my aunts had cancer and she barley made it out of treatment alive. Then a month or so after that my gf and I broke up and everything has gone to complete shit after this. A few months into my senior year I woke up with massive swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and extreme fatigue. My parents and I assume it was mono (yes I went to dozens of doctors and never found an active ebv infection just antibodies), and I still don’t feel well and am scared I developed a chronic illness from when I was sick. 

Then my dog died a few months after I graduated and moved away from home for work. A few months after that I had a sort of near death experience where I was carjacked while leaving the grocery store. Thennnnn a day after Christmas we found out my other aunt has cancer all over her body and she is pretty much on her death bed. 

All of this I feel like has compounded and I honestly just feel so numb to emotions, I don’t remember what feeling happy and physically healthy/normal is like anymore. I just feel like a zombie. 

I don’t even think about my future that much because I literally feel like I’m just trying to get through the day. 

Thanks for coming to my rant, I doubt anyone made it this far.

depression,1ien13u,Sometimes I wish I would just disappear,"I’m a pointless human being. I have no communication skills, I’m a slow learner. I’m almost positive I have some undiagnosed disorder, either a form of autism, ADHD, OCD. Something, I’m not sure. Maybe all of the above for all I know. 

I can’t handle the constant fear and anxiety 24 hours a day. It never goes away. 

They tell me I just need to try harder, get out of my comfort zone. I’ve done that. It doesn’t work. 

I can’t get a good career because I can’t motivate or encourage myself to do anything. I feel like a complete useless piece of crap. 

Suicide isn’t an option because I don’t want to traumatize my parents. The reason I hate myself is because I don’t want to disappoint them, and the reason I don’t end it is also because I don’t want to disappoint them. 

I wish I’d just disappear and everyone would just forget about me.

depression,1ien12m,THOUGHTS THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT,"I found this draft in my old phone. 5yrs later and I made it. Still working on being better but getting the help that I need and managing well. 


THOUGHTS THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT

This is for you, Dr. Genevie Fruylan,

For the first time in years that I suffered alone in silence, I asked for help, only to not be taken seriously and have my feelings invalidated by some other people who had it better. No matter how petty this may look to you, it's hurting me a thousand fold. It's not something you can just brush aside with a mere 'prayer' or 'open communication' I need help, and you failed to provide that.

People often say everything will be better once you say it out louder, in my case, everything just got worse.

You don't know how much it hurts to have someone look at you like you are just some 8 year old girl who couldn't get a cotton candy in the country fair. The courage it took for me to open up is like trying to swim out in the open sea after drowning for quite some time, the struggle is real. Picture this, I was drowning and afraid of dying so I tried to swim ashore, I saw you, you saw me, I reached out my hand, you held mine, then suddenly let go. In no time, I was back down below. Drowning, afraid of dying, but is no longer trying.

For the longest time, I've tried. For myself, for everyone who relies on me, for those who believe in me, and for those who suffer just like me. I keep on trying for the people who lost their will to keep on living. I tried to make everything seem normal even though I'm slowly crumbling. I'm trying because I'm still hoping that everything will pass, someday everything will be better. I know, my bouts of sadness is nothing compared to other people you know and nowhere near your standard of ""depression"" but I do hope you realize that people who had it worse, would never consider asking for your opinion.

When people tell you their stories, the BEST you can do is be there for them, LISTEN. Do not compare our sufferings to your friends who had it better just by praying to Padre Pio in Libiz, QC. This is no competition on who is the saddest of them all, it's about compassion and understanding the situation.

It was so hard, to open up to someone whom you thought might help but instead made you feel worse about yourself. The unwelcomed feeling that I was avoiding, you led it back to me. 

But now I'm learning. Learning whom to trust, whom to seek for help, whom to open up to. Your mere invalidation and judgement led me to feel other emotions rather than sadness, well you made me question my self worth more than necessary but you also made me angry. Anger is good. Anger is better to hold onto rather than pain. You're lucky, I chose this path. Not all of us who bear your cruel judgement would chose to fight, most will simply crumble and choose to kill themselves.

Here's a lesson for you, Doctor: just be there, listen, and don't compare. Not everyone is fighting the same battles, not everyone is handling the same situations in the same extent, some handle it poorly. Be more compassionate as you are understanding, they go hand in hand.

I'll pray for you.

depression,1iel98a,Siento que no tengo amigos,"Buenas, vengo a desahogarme y a expresar un poco como me siento.

Siempre fui una persona bastante sociable, sin embargo, hace poco viaje con una amiga y no la pase muy bien, esta amiga es una persona bastante cerrada e insegura, tiene mucha ansiedad y básicamente reprime cualquier sentimiento para darle uso a la razon, no la pase nada bien, no queria sacarse fotos conmigo, no hablaba con nadie y me sentia bastante inhibido para establecer vinculos con otras personas, asi que un dia  ella no queria salir a cenar por quedarse viendo una serie y decidi salir a caminar a la noche solo, esa situación me genero replantearme un monton mi calidad de amistades y todo mi entorno en general.

Basicamente, a pesar de ser una persona sociable a partir de la adolescencia perdi a mis amigos de toda la vida porque soy gay y sufri mucho bullying y exclusión en el colegio, a raiz de eso me volvi bastante forro, me bardeaba con todo el mundo y mucha gente me odiaba por eso, en ese momento es cuando empece a establecer vinculos con gente que podriamos catalogar como los ""excluidos"", gente que le hacian bullying, con varios quilombos y mambos tipo ansiedad cronica, depresion, intento de suicidio, abuso sexual, etc.

Dato de color: Hasta el año 2020 estuve en una depresion importante, donde compartia varios de esos mambos.

En este viaje me di cuenta de que no se que tanto me ayudan estos vinculos a salir adelante, en un momento de mi vida me encontre bastante bien con ellos, porque sentia que estaba igual de mambeado porque tenia muchos problemas en mi casa por mi sexualidad, no conseguia trabajo, no queria tener vinculos sexuales ni amorosos con nadie, pero con el tiempo pude hablar en mi casa, expresar como me sentia y mis viejos me aceptaron a su manera, pude presentar a mi novio y conseguir un trabajo estable, comence a viajar solo y me recorri casi todo America del Sur de mochilero, lo que me dio mucha confianza en mi mismo y me sentia muy bien, no obstante, desde que me replantee esta situacion comenzó a afectarme al darme cuenta de que todo mi entorno esta muy quedado, es decir, nadie se recibió y tenemos casi 30 años, la mayoria es virgen o jamas tuvo una pareja mas alla de un encuentro sexual casual, siguen con depresión y la verdad que sumado a eso nadie me escribio durante el viaje o despues a ver como estaba, me di cuenta que basicamente que no les importa mucho como estoy, siempre que nos juntamos (para los cumpleaños generalmente, porque ya no se propone nada fuera de eso), es para hablar de cosas tristes, del pasado, del bullying que sufrimos en el colegio y siento que quiero salir de eso y establecer nuevos vinculos.

 Sorry por el testamento, necesitaba desahogarme un poco.

depression,1iel7wi,The world may not be so bad ?,"To be frank, I was suicidal for a long period of time, Philosophy fucks your head up especially existentialism. It makes you numb and makes you scared to live and to die. A state of limbo of pure fear. This can be further fueled by religion, say what you want but the fear of hell is a cause of many existential crises. Then there's the fear of ruining your life. You wanna fix your fucked up life but can't, you're too tired, you're too drained and people constantly tell you ""no such thing as depression get over that shit"" and the slightly more empathetic ones give you goddamn helplines which let's be honest who the fuck would call ? All of this piles up and causes such a tiredness such a fear such a humiliation alongside responcibilities for your future, grades, money,  the fear of your DEATH the constant overthinking. That you just want it to end. Though to be frank this mindset gets you nowhere. At times it'd be easier to just get amnesia and start again, but the hand we have is the only one we will ever get. So don't try anything drastic but know, you will succeed in whatever you want to succeed. Success is only personal and no matter what others say about you needing money or a spouse or any other bullshit values. Stay true to your goddamn self. Fuck girls, have fun with friends, go out, try to find something productive and fun. Workout for just simple selfish wants like getting a girlfriend. Hell just be TRUE to yourself and stop listening to others. Start small, ignore the forced values, get a simple routine and build confidence, workout and maybe try to socialize in school or some kind of sports clubs (Method I used) or hell even online with others just don't become incels. You can do it, no matter what you think. You can do it I'm not gonna say you can do it because some other goddamn paralysed kid did it (I don't mean to be rude but people keep comparing and it's really annoying) but you can do it because you, are you.

depression,1iekiuv,I would pay someone to kill me,"Every single day I wake up I wish I didn’t. I’m 24yr old female, and ever since I was 8 I haven’t had the will to live. In high school I tried therapy and antidepressants but it always seemed to make me worse. I’ve spent a majority in of my life on and off meds. When I graduated hs in 2019, I got to go away to college but I broke up with my 4 year long high school boyfriend for the thrill of school. Worst decision I ever made. I wanted an open relationship, since we had only ever been with each other. I would strongly advise being in a relationship that young. And if you are young and in love, end it now. Covid happened my first spring break, forcing me back home where I now had no one. I’ve spent years trying to help myself, get through college, and build a career for myself. I failed college and dropped out and most of my friends are a year out now, living their dream lives with degrees. I started working full time for an eye doctor for 2 years when I should have been trying harder in college. I’m now at an eye surgeon, and I would do anything to go back in time. Everyone I’m surrounded by and work with has a degree, certification or something going for them. I grew up dyslexic and I was told I’ve “grown out of it” yet I still struggle every single day. I’ve had so many failed relationships and friendships because I have no love for myself whatsoever. If I could pay someone to end this for me, I would. I’ve tried accessing the dark web so many times yet I can’t figure it out. There’s a small voice in the back of my head that believes in me, but that voice has no clue what’s it’s talking about and clearly doesn’t know that I’m not capable of much. I have no relationship with my family, I cut them off when I disappointed them by failing college so many times. There’s no point to this story other than the fact that I’m struggling to stay alive. I have two brothers and the one makes triple my salary by starting some online company. He travels and does whatever he wants, meanwhile I can’t even find the will to live. He’s younger than me too, which is a punch in the gut. I seriously don’t know how munch longer I’ll be on this earth. I’m so tired.  ",1,2025-01-31 18:44:47,3,0.67,laurbear119

depression,1iebukn,Somebody talk to me.,"My sister died in April last year, she was my older sister, fifteen years apart. She basically raised me like a mother would (my relationship with my mother has always been complicated Since childhood) my sister has always been my emotional support. 

I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since I was fifteen and in the meantime I lost my grandfather, my grandmother, uncles, friends.. I almost lost my Mom and dad at times (thei are over 60 years old and have dangerous jobs) nothing made me scream like when my sister had a brain aneurysm. I saw her die due to hospital negligence, she had nine seizures and died of a heart attack. I held her for an hour, watched her eyes bulge and the sound her body made when she couldn't breathe anymore. It's been almost a year and I still can't sleep at night without remembering how she died, it's torture.

Shortly after burying her, Weeks later, I had to quit my job because my mother got sick (She has depression and was feeling unwell, but she had to have surgery, for another reason obviously, she almost died on the operating table) my father had an accident at work shortly after (they are fine now) Because of all this, I didn't have time to grieve i had to deal with two post-surgery surgeries and my mother's depression, soon after, my grandmother wasn't well, I had to run with everyone. 

I had depression, I had a lot of anxiety attacks, I was alone in another city with my sick parents without any support, I had to cope... But then I broke down, My life, which was already difficult, became hell, I live in hell now, I'm 24 years old, I have two friends in different states, hours away and a lot of money for tickets separates us, no relationship, no job, no money, and my psychologist went on vacation for three fucking months!! I haven't taken medication for over 3 years and I refuse to go back to sertraline, lithium and sedatives, that wasn't even surviving, it was being a vegetable. 

The thing is! I'm not going to die, I'm suicidal but I'm not going to die because I refuse to give up, I've already invested too much time and money in this life to give up now. But I'm sad And alone, I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating, I've lost more than 15 kilos in less than a month, I don't remember the last time I saw the sun, I don't feel human but I still am but no one seems to notice that, I need to eat, I need the sun and I need someone to talk to me even though I know it could take me days to respond because most days I don't have the energy to open my eyes!! please, please!

Throughout Primary School I got bullied by people, there were some people who didn’t really care about what the bullies thought of me and would talk to me regardless which made me happy as I had people I could hang out with during break times/lunchtimes.

Then came secondary school, now I didn’t have much problem with the bullies then since I wasn’t in their classes which made me happy but some of my friends from primary school wasn’t in my classes too, so I made some more friends to talk to.

Throughout high school I started developing a negative situation to food and would try and eat less food to make myself feel good, that went away for a while as I usually just kept it to myself and never really told anyone. (My parents still don’t know that I experienced this.) 

I can’t tell my friends about this as I’m what you would call “The Therapist Friend” this friend would make sure everyone else was okay and put their own feelings aside just to support the people/friends around them. Plus some of my friends are already happy and joyful and I don’t want to make them feel sad and have them worrying about me being sad etc.

Some of my friends is Happy and joyful and some of them have their own mental health stuff they are going through and I like to cheer them up by gifting them chocolate as who doesn’t like chocolate plus it can cheer people up.

Overall I just want to feel happy and be there for people, I mean I already have god I can talk to but I want to be happy, feel happy and just live life feeling joyful.

TL:DR - I feel sad but I want to be happy again.",1,2025-01-31 17:12:18,0,1.0,MurkyMath2018

I live with my girlfriend and she is paying the majority of bills. I am struggling in this career as even entering this career I had 20k in debt and credit score is out the window. I am digging my hole deeper as I work freelance (busy season in the warmer temperature months, dead in the cold months) and I have not filed taxes in 2 years. I have no drive anymore, I don't post my work or use social media to market myself, I started gaining weight. I have no credit cards and no money to spare on equipment that I desperately need to excel in my job or barely contribute to living expenses.

I have a million interests and ideas and make 1% effort to tackle them before giving up. I have no health insurance, no motivations, and constantly think about suicide or going missing. Each year has progressively gotten worse since I turned 22 after my last relationship and attempt suicide. I have gone to therapy twice in recent years with it only making me feel worse about the world, psychoanalyzing the entire helpless process. I need to exercise, establish my career using tools I already have around me. Learn things around my craft and discipline myself. I need to stop endlessly scrolling and being lazy. Stop making excuses for myself and blaming my parents. Things I do have to my advantage is I am extremely self-aware and very charismatic. Somewhat handsome as well which has largely gotten me this far in life, but I can see myself becoming a worse person as the days pass.

depression,1iea61u,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m just going to be completely honest and say what’s going on with my life and how I feel:

I’m 22(M), 6’3”, I live with my parents, recently got fired from my job. 

I don’t take any hard drugs, I rarely intake weed and I occasionally drink.

I think I have a pornography addiction (usually masturbate 1 every 2-3 days) and have been doing so since I was 14-15. 

The longest I’ve lasted on semen retention was around 2 weeks.

I’m a virgin/haven’t been in a relationship, most likely cuz my communication is pretty bad. I could talk to women but I can never flirt well or take anything to the next because I give up to easily and I tell myself it could never happen. Which I know I could share how I feel but I’m afraid of rejection. 

I’m pretty quiet and really only talk when people want me to or when I think it’s appropriate to.

I don’t ever like to leave my home unless if I have to go to work or college. I’m only going to college so I could try to have some sort of value in life, otherwise I really don’t want to go. 

I don’t have a license, I could take a test but I have a feeling that I might crash or fail the test. 

I don’t have a credit card. 

I stay in my room for the most part studying art, playing games/watching media or to sleep. But most of these hobbies, I barely feel like continuing.

I like to sleep but I can never get good sleep as, for the most part, i feel very sluggish when waking up (even when i get the right amount of hours). If I wake up really early, I would go work out. If I don’t wake up early, it’s hard for me to do much. 

I constantly keep talking to myself, I have full on conversations with just myself and I question if I’m psychotic.

I stopped taking meds because I’ve felt no difference from when I was taking them. 

I sometimes just go blank, without any thought in my mind until I snap out of it and realize I walked to the kitchen. 

I stress out when talking to people on the phone, especially when I wanna make an appointment.

Talking with some people in can be very draining to me, I sometimes feel like I have force out conversations and I hate it. I want to be engaged in a conversation without feeling so.

I constantly have random negative thoughts, thinking my life is over, or thinking that something terrible is eventually going to happen in my life. I think that I’m just gonna be forgotten.

Even though I don’t show it to many people, I feel like my life is crashing down silently.

I really wanted to take my own life at 19/20. I just felt like I don’t deserve anymore chances. I sometimes just hope that I just fall asleep and never wake up again.

I genuinely don’t even consume anything really negative but my thoughts only.

I think my family/parents worry for me and I don’t want them to. I think I just need someone to relate to and possibly give advice on how to overcome what I’m going through. 

I’ll respond as truthfully as I can.",4,2025-01-31 09:16:10,3,1.0,Possible_Durian_1675
depression,1idw7cw,"I have no personality, ambition or skills","I don’t even really have interests.

I’ve spent my whole life trying to just cope with being depressed or seeking validation from other people. I have a general apathy towards basically everything. People ask me basic questions about where I live and simple life skills and I don’t know the answers because I never cared (I’m 24). 

I don’t even listen to music. Can’t get into art because I suck. Don’t care much for shows, anime, cartoons, etc. I work in software but I’m terrible at it and shouldn’t have a job if I’m being honest. No passion for anything. 

No desire to travel, seek companionship, improve myself, or do much of anything. And I’ve ALWAYS been like this

I excelled in school for literally no reason other than being a good test taker and it gave me such an overinflated sense of ego that I just made that my personality when I was in school but stepped out into the real world and realized that doesn’t matter AT ALL

My friends are starting to realize I have no depth and are becoming more distant to hang out with each other because they tell me talking to me is like talking to a brick wall. 

Videogames and doomscrolling to numb the pain are ALL I have and even then I still miss out on the newest things on social media and I’m shit at videogames. And because of these things my brain is rotted to its core 

In therapy, on meds and have small support network but I genuinely have nothing to work with to get better. I’m a dead end everywhere I look. But I have all the advantages in the world. I’m not ugly, I’m not stupid, I have no trauma, a loving family that pays for everything. Everything is the fact that all I do is run away from myself. 

I can’t connect with people on any level because there’s just nothing there and I’m too paralyzed to take the first steps to find out who I am. 

I can’t even bring myself to hurt myself. I just don’t give a fuck and I’m just gonna suffer like this until I just give away one day

depression,1iego2z,I am reaching a breaking point and I do not know what to do,"I’m 18F and feel like a complete failure in every part of my life—family, friends, academics, and relationships. I feel like a burden to everyone, and nothing I do ever seems good enough.

Since childhood, I’ve felt unloved, especially by my mother, who always seemed annoyed and angry with me. She crushed my confidence early on, and I became isolated, struggling with social skills. In kindergarten, I had one best friend, but when we changed schools, my parents never let me see her again. My dad gave empty promises, while my mom was blunt, saying she had probably forgotten me and didn’t want to see me. I stopped asking after that.

I started self-harming when I was around seven—hitting myself, banging my head against walls—thinking it might fix me and make my parents love me. I even attempted to take my own life at that age. I once tied myself thinking that I should be tied up since I am just as stupid as an animal. I felt worthless, like I didn’t deserve to exist. I once took a knife, but my uncle took it away, not realizing what I intended to do.

At school, I felt invisible. I only started making friends in 7th grade, but I was still bullied—mocked for my name, body, and being a foreigner. Girls excluded me because I was tomboyish and assumed I was a lesbian, treating me like a threat. At 12, I started cutting myself, after my whole garde started mocking me due to my math teacher calling me stupid. 

Nowadays I barely speak to my middle school friends, nor the friends that I made in my new high school. Because I always end up deceiving them due to my poor communication skills. Whenever I tried to communicate everything seems to come out wrong. I did not get my high school diploma despite having tried twice, I was due to go study in Canada and my study permit got denied also twice. My boyfriend thinks I am too much and doesn't know how to handle my mood swings anymore. Nor do my friends. It feels so lonely, a few days ago I was really thinking of ending it, and I still are to be honest. 

Now I living with my parents, still applying to universities, but the smallest mistake makes them criticize me, calling me lazy, and reminding me of how much of a burden I am. Once those one sided arguments ( because I do not answer when they yell at me and just lower my head ) escalated so much that my dad yelled at me to just self exit at this point, handing me  knife to get the job done, he even told me that if we were in another country he would have done it himself. He also said that he doesn't need me as he has other kids and can still make more.

I do have medical help from a psychiatrist and a psychologist and am on medication, but my dad hates it and just thinks I am weak. I scared that one day he will take it away from me. 

Now I am hurt, lonely, am constantly reminded of how weird and a burden I am. All I ever wanted is to be needed or wanted by someone. Just to feel worth it, but it never seemed to be the case, and it hurst so much.",1,2025-01-31 16:00:29,0,1.0,InternationalStay682

Why? Probably it's a defensive tecnique that my mind pull out when I'm feeling ""attacked"".

depression,1ieedu5,Hello people,"I just turned 23, and English is not my language 
Sorry if it’s messy, I just wanted to write, I hope I’m not bothering

I really often spend days / weeks alone in my flat, just watching YouTube videos, shorts, porn, whatever, eating bad things / not eating at all, doing nothing and hating myself for it
I found escapism in the urge of buying things. So I look about things to buy, dream about how my life would be so much better if I had this or this.. sometimes I buy it, knowing I have barely enough money to pay my rent. But then I just want more.

I know it’s bad because you romanticise the situations you don’t know, but I envy them. I really want to be a student, a worker.. Waking up in the morning, going to the same place everyday with the same people, making friends there..

I’m a musician, I’m about to sign a deal, music is the only thing I’ve known in my life. I feel like I’m losing my passion for music because of the pressure of being cool, consistent, stylish, and good.. listening to music close to mine makes me feel so fckin anxious now, bc it reminds me that I’m bad in comparison, and that I probably don’t even deserve to exist artistically, that I’m a joke.
And music is me, even more since I go on stage to sing, so when I think that, I think I’m shit & useless as a human too.
 I’m also feeling shitty for not enjoying my position, so it’s making it even worse. 
Sometimes, I’m really happy too. And it might be, to me, the worse of it. Because then it’s hard to follow / know what you really think, how you really feel. I can’t trust myself. 
I never make choices. In my relationship, my life, my ""career"".. I do my best to avoid needing to choose. The idea that the decision I’d make could be the wrong one is killing me, I’d rather let it flow even if sometimes it’s bad for me or anything.
I think i’m scared of decisions, ridicule, shame.
It’s also a ego question, because you want to be someone, you want to be the best friend, the best artist, the best person. The idea that i could be none of this is burning me inside, why would I do this then ? Why would I even live ?",1,2025-01-31 14:08:08,1,1.0,Boudaoul

I had a terrible relationship with my mother and my dad’s character wasn’t strong enough to help me. At 18 y.o I got into my first serious relationship that lasted 2,5 years and from looking like a fairytale it ended up very abusive. I had zero help from my family and I was severely traumatised. My second relationship with a guy who was a drug addict and it was traumatising as well. I went to therapy and fixed my relationship with my mother at least although I have learned to rely on my own. I am in a healthy relationship now,it’s not perfect but it’s a good one with a good base. The thing is that I think I sabotage myself and the good things. I don’t want to marry him or ever get married since in my head men prefer hoes and I’m trying to decide where I want to be. Plus I don’t trust men at all. I also have a love-hate relationship with myself and I’m able to empathise a lot with others and help them but it’s like sometimes I want to punish my boyfriend for loving me by telling him I’m not a good person or in general by pushing him away. I don’t always do that because I show him a lot of love but I still do that. I love the stability he shows me and provides me but sometimes my brain is telling me to just go meet other guys, create short term experiences with them and do drugs(I’m taking seroquel btw but my psychiatrist doesn’t have a clear picture to diagnose me with something since I’ve been having random phases for ex.

depression,1ie9nel,Help me find peace,"
I feel so empty and sad. From the moment I wake up to right before I go to sleep, all I can think about is how I could’ve done things differently in my life. My thoughts overwhelm me, and sometimes I just want to shut down and sleep so I don’t have to think anymore.

I often view myself as a third person, watching situations and scenarios unfold, and it feels like I’m detached from my own life. This is now something that happens whilst I’m having conversations with people and after I leave them. 

I have two children (8 and 16), and I know I’ve done the best I can for them, but I still feel this heavy guilt. I don’t have a good relationship with my family, and there’s a lot of resentment about the way I was raised and treated throughout my life.

On top of that, I’ve had an amazing relationship with my husband for the last 16 years. He’s supportive, hands-on, and wonderful but despite everything he does, I just can’t seem to feel happiness within myself. I get these fleeting moments of relief when I forget I am me but then a scenario plays out in my head (nothing particular triggers it) and it eats away at me again.

I just want to be able to enjoy the moment, stop feeling resentful and miserable, and have a better relationship with my children. I’m struggling to find peace in any decisions I have made/ make and feel like I’m constantly battling myself.

It started off where I was walking down this path going over hills and valleys, birds were chirping and the leaves of the trees were blowing. I then walked a long way to my house to see all of my best friends there, they all wanted to hang out. There was also this girl, I don't know why but all I know is she was beautiful and had a great personality. I then walked with all my Freind down the highway to Costco for some reason. As we were walking back me and the beautiful woman started talking to me as we were best friends. Then a car passed and I saw a black shadowy figure and he asked me to follow him, so I did. After that i remember me walking back down that valley again, but this time on a bike. I was tore up beat and shaking scared it seemed that I was almost dead, as I got home the woman was sitting on a bench and ran into my arms to give me a hug, we then sat on a bench and held hands watching the sun set with all my friends next to me. I remember being happy in that moment, I quickly realized that this couldn't be real the women then tried to kiss me and... I woke up.

The guy I've liked the most in my whole life, am obsessed with and was the only person I was close with and relied on for the past 4 years, has replaced me for someone he barely likes. We had an argument, and instead of putting in any effort to solve things he's decided to distract himself with someone else and ignore me. No fucks given about my feelings. On top of that he's a huge narcissist, with all the toxicity that that comes with.


Both my parents suck. My mother is the most controlling and manipulative cunt I've ever met and only gives a shit about me when it suits her to make her look good to others, deep down inside she doesn't care. My father is a selfish asshole who only cares about himself and loves to mistreat others, even if he pretends the opposite. He REALLY doesn't give a flying fuck about me and I doubt he ever did. Both my parents probably think shit about me and only acknowledge my presence whenever they randomly feel like. Most of the time they ignore me.


I don't have anyone else. I've pushed everyone away probably due to fear of having the same relationship with them that I have with my parents. I wish I could have a couple pf friends but at the same time I couldn't be less interested in having people around. I've been diagnosed with Mixed Anxiety Depressive Disorder and also am on the low side of the bipolar spectrum. We're still trying to figure out, but my psychiatrist also thinks I might have ASPD/SzPD (or any of the avoidant/antisocial types) and on top of that I probably have BPD too.


I'm just so tired of everything. It's not that I'm completely out of resources, but considering what I have, I am the one supposed to use what I have at my disposal and make a move to improve my life. To make the big change. But I just simply have no motivation to do so. Everything seems so blurry and it's becoming really difficult for me to picture myself having a future.

We could learn these lessons in the spiritual realm, but it would take much longer and not be as fun. The equivalent of doing something hands on vs. Learning from a textbook. 

I know this. I feel it to be true. And yet somehow, that doesn’t stop me from being so tired of life here. I was with a friend and the sun was setting and I sighed and they laughed, “what? Too much for you?” And I laughed. But in reality yes - I sighed at the fact that another day was happening. That’s crazy. It was literally too much. Like Jesus Christ, the sun just rises and sets day after day. 

The fires in LA were happening. It was the day after the first day it all started and I had to go to work. I was nervous to go out because of the wind conditions. And then I thought; wait - I say I want to kill myself all the time, so why am I afraid to leave the house right now? And that was the thought that made me feel okay to leave. 

Crossing the street, not being too careful hoping to get hit by a car. Not preparing for things as I usually would because nothing actually matters.

I know deep down they do matter, this is literally why we’re here - because it’s hard and monotonous and that’s how you learn and grow as a soul. And being depressed over how naturally depressing it is makes me feel like a pussy.

My body has never went past the point of getting wet. I don’t think I have ever had an orgasm. I’m so sick of feeling broken. My body is broken. My body is broken in multiple ways; I don’t think my body has the ability to orgasm and I know it doesn’t have the ability to relax enough to let penetration happen. I feel like my body is a painful burden I have to bear.

When I’ve talked about this with other people, they’ve expressed concern or have said that it’s “heavy”. After I talked to one person about my body image and how I feel about my body, they said that they couldn’t talk to me about it anymore because it upset them to hear how upset I was (crying and distressed) about it.

I’m tired of living in my body. When I think about dying or suicide my body is the main reason why I would want to or consider dying. I’m in physical pain everyday, and I also have severe depression. My life had a lot of problems when I was ten but it has more problems now and I’m worn down from experiencing years of severe depression and years of chronic physical pain.

How does someone know if they’re experiencing sexual pleasure? I’m starting to wonder if my body is so broken that I’ve never experienced it.

I don’t understand why I had to have this body. Teenage girls (18+), women my age, and women decades older than me are able to experience sexual pleasure, have an orgasm (or even multiple) by themselves, with a partner or both and are able to let a man enter them and move as fast as they want. I don’t understand why I’m stuck in this body.

I’ve cried a ton over my body over the past six months. I’ve felt like I’m mourning something. I feel a deep sense of lack. I’m starting to wonder if I never developed a sense of sexuality or it was damaged in some way. It’s like I have no sexuality or it disappeared or died. I feel really depressed.

My body has been this broken for a long time. I’ve seen women in their twenties post about having vaginal sex easily with their partners, managing to have an orgasm, etc. I feel like my body is my enemy. I feel like I’m going to look up over ten years from now, be 35 years old and be wondering why I wasn’t able to have what all other women easily have. I feel like I’m mourning any hope of being a desirable partner, having a partner, having any meaningful relationship. My body has let me down.

I don’t even know if I could feel comfortable letting a partner close to me at all (even kissing me) because I know that even if I liked being close to someone I would be dreading and afraid that it would make them want PIV. Having vaginismus has ruined more than my vagina and my value as a woman; it’s ruined my body image, mental health, and how I see relationships.

I almost feel afraid of men’s anatomy and I know this fear stems from the fact that due to having the body that I have, a man trying to enter me would hurt and would be a failure unless they forced it (which would be very painful). It’s all my body’s fault. I feel really fed up with and frustrated with my body.

The reason I say I wish sexuality didn’t exist is because it’s a source of a lot of disappointment and pain for me. I mean, I’ve tried to fix my body to make it as good as other women naturally are, but it hasn’t worked to fix it. I don’t know if I never developed the sexuality I should have today, or if my sexuality has died because I can’t go past arousal anyway. I don’t stimulate myself externally anymore; it never did anything, let alone lead to an orgasm. I feel so broken and exhausted. People say to trust your body but I don’t trust my body. I don’t trust my body at all and I feel like it’s betrayed me and caused me so much pain.

I feel like I’m outside of womanhood. I shouldn’t feel
this way. People perceive me as being a woman, but I feel like I don’t experience what other women do. I can’t feel what they feel, I lack the worth they possess naturally even though I’ve tried to attain it, and I can’t relate to them.

It’s kind of sad and distressing to think about how much difference it makes in a woman’s life whether a part of her inside functions or not. I’m so sick of my body.

My body has made me feel suicidal before. I don’t know why my body is such a failure. Other women don’t see PIV how I do and don’t have nothing but problems when it comes to their bodies and sex. It’s so depressing. I feel like sexuality has been a disappointing thing for me.

I feel like I’m lacking something as a woman. I feel upset because I can’t tell if I have a sense of sexuality or not. I’m able to become aroused, but nothing else happens. I don’t think my body can have anything else happens. My body is broken and fucked up. There are eighteen year old women who can orgasm by themselves or with a partner, including women who can orgasm easily or have multiple. I don’t think my body has the capacity to; it’s truly broken.

I can’t trust my body. It’s not trustworthy. Sometimes I wish parts of my body didn’t exist; I don’t like living in my body because it’s painful everyday.",0,2025-01-31 08:41:37,1,0.5,Throwthisawaysoon999
depression,1idyqt7,End of the road,"
I have 1 huge regret in life & now can’t get past it. It’s all I think about & it effects everything I do. Even sleep doesn’t cure the pain. I know I have to figure out how to accept it but I feel paralyzed. All I do is think about what my life would be like if I never made this bad decision. 
I also try to tell myself it was the best decision(in my mind) at the time. I listened to the wrong people & will be paying for this the rest of my life. 
It getting to the point where the only way I can make it all stop, is ending my life. 
I really need support on this one & how to move on from an awful, life changing bad decision.

depression,1ie65aj,am i depressed? i just need help and sympathy,"23M. I’m not even sure where to begin. As a kid, I was driven and really valued how intelligent I thought I was. I’d always receive high honors at school and thought I could get a career in anything with. I even remember my family saying it was a given that I’d end up at Harvard. And because attending Harvard or an equally prestigious college was the end-all-be-all for 10 year old me, I really prioritized getting the best grades.   (I thought being accepted to a good university was the end of it — from there, employers would be dying to hire me! … how wrong I was.) 

Sometime throughout middle school, I think I learned to work smarter rather than harder, so I coasted until high school graduation, somehow achieving good grades while procrastinating every assignment and getting away with the least amount of effort. What I didn’t know was that despite my stellar report card, I was cultivating a very poor work ethic, the consequences of which I wouldn’t feel until later. The first sign of that came when I was rejected by most of the elite colleges I had applied to, and deferred by two. No acceptances, crippling my self esteem. By miraculously managing to get off the waitlist for one of them, I was going to an elite college, which I hoped would put me back on my original “smart and ambitious” track by surrounding me with some of the brightest students in the country.

Wrong. While I made some great friends and cherish many memories during those 4 years, I can’t say it helped my self esteem; rather, it further deteriorated it. I kept up my coasting attitude, which still did the job, but I knew that if I were truly put to the test, I could never live up to these other smart and driven kids. Unlike them, I was lazy and incompetent: a terrible mix if I say so myself. While they would go on to work at stellar companies and be the next leaders and innovators (at least I’m proud to call them my friends), I would go on to work at the only job I could get — another product of barely scraping by, which I deep down believe was undeserved and merely luck. In fact, I can’t imagine hiring someone who can’t list one real tangible skill he learned from college (seriously!).

I have since started my job, and for the last 6 months, I’ve barely been given any work. My manager is a great guy, but he doesn’t push me, so my coasting attitude is only reinforced. I keep dreading the day everything will blow up in my face: my company will figure out how useless I am, my family will learn how unrealized I am on a deeper level, my friends will realize how incompetent I am, etc. It’s like I want to get up and start from ground zero and work towards something without any prior expectations, but the path I’m on does not seem to allow it unless I’m fired and relocate to another country, where I can truly start from zero again. In other words, I wish I could just reset life.

I despise living my day to day just wallowing in self pity and attacking myself for not living up to my potential, for unknowingly making a catastrophic error somewhere in my development that led me to this self deprecating existence. Perhaps my expectations when I was younger were too high? But at least I had hope! Now I just feel hopeless and too far behind, even though everything may look marvelous on paper…just like my report card. But if you look beyond the surface, you’ll just see a good for nothing individual who’s constantly lucked out. 

I’m not sure if I’m depressed or have ADHD. The subreddits I come across of people with similar issues point to those two, but I’ve never gotten diagnosed nor have bothered to see a doctor. I like to think this problem starts and ends with me. It’s just that inertia makes it very overwhelming to begin real change. In fact, it’s that inertia which leads me to being lazy in my opinion. I know everyone starts somewhere, but I just wish I had some ambition and natural talent that gave me some reason to exist in at least one sphere of life. Some sing, others write books, a few create awesome inventions, but I just sit here and bash myself for being worthless. All around me I see gifted, intelligent, driven people. Even the technology and media I interact with are constant reminders: how the f*** could I ever begin to build or create anything like that?! Telling myself pretty things about how I matter just doesn’t do it for me, I just go back to the depressing, yet accurate self descriptions. Self fulfilling cycle of negativity I guess.

If younger me could see me now, I bet he’d be very disappointed. I just wish I could start again. I also wish God or the universe could’ve installed the ambition gene in me so I’d go after it and get it, but at this point I just can’t help but do nothing. True success, that fulfillment one feels internally, not what my “fake” resume with its “achievements” shows, seems so out of reach. 

I surf Reddit constantly to see if anyone else feels how I do, and thankfully(?), it doesn’t seem like I’m the only one. But that doesn’t solve the problem. I just need a definitive plan, I can’t keep going like this. While I’d never truly do the s-word, I can’t say I haven’t given it playful thought considering how overwhelming and futile I feel my existence to be. I clearly want to reorganize my life and attitude, given this post. I just have no idea where to start when it seems like I’m stuck in a pit of misery and inertia.

Sorry for the long winded post and thank you for reading. I have other posts on similar topics in my account if you need further context, I bet this is hard to comprehend if you don’t constantly live inside my troubled head.



TL;DR
I grew up thinking success would come naturally but coasted instead of building real skills. Now, in my job, I feel like a fraud with no ambition or direction, stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and inertia. I want to change but don’t know where to start.",2,2025-01-31 04:53:27,0,1.0,enderbite
depression,1ie9nyw,"I’m tired of being alone, but don’t know how to fix it?","I’m tired of being alone, but don’t know how to fix it?

Yesterday, (m20) while preparing my notes for my therapy session, I reminisced about my high school past. This led me to a profound realization: I had wasted both my high school and teenage years. Tears welled up in my eyes as I grappled with the fact that not only could I change my past, but I also yearned for the closeness of my old friends and classmates. It’s been two years since I graduated, and I haven’t seen or spoken to anyone since. I’ve lost all my friends, and loneliness gnaws at me relentlessly. It’s even worse than when I was still in school. I’m exhausted by this loneliness. I crave someone who shares my interests, accepts me unconditionally, and doesn’t see me as a disappointment or a burden, like my mother who exacerbates my life. I long for someone to love me, to embrace me every day, but that hasn’t happened in almost two years. 

When I was crying, it wasn’t just some tears, it felt really hard and painful, as if I’ve been holding in my emotions for a long time. The last time I cried was on my birthday last year, and since the. I rarely cry, not because I hold it in, but because there are now certain things that trigger my emotions. Anne Frank once said “Crying can bring relief, as long as you’re not alone.” and I now know how it feels.  

And turns out that for some stupid reason, the front doors to my therapy office were locked even tho it was supposed to be open, and I had a god damn appointment! When I called they didn’t explain the looked doors, but all they said was that I could change my appointment, so I hanged up out of frustration.

Moreover, I’m weary of engaging in conversations with strangers online, even if we know each other. It feels strange and unsettling, and I’m sick and tired of it. I miss the days when I could simply talk to my old classmates and friends. But it’s too late for that now. All those connections are gone. I feel utterly alone, and I’m at a loss for what to do with my life. ",1,2025-01-31 08:38:16,1,1.0,CtrlAltElite24
depression,1ie62nb,i feel like my depression isn't valid because i'm not hurting myself,"i'm a senior in highschool and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for about 4 years now (starting in 8th grade). a lot was also happening at the time due to being quarantined, but my situation is much more different (and i feel much more comfortable in my daily life). however, even with having this diagnosis, it feels like i'm undeserving of being called ""depressed"".

i know i shouldn't compare myself to others, but i have friends who have so much shit going on in their own lives, but they manage to come to school every day and excel in their classes (i go to a specialized school, everyone here is SMART smart.. i'm somewhere in the middle of that and the people who don't try). they can get 90's/high A's, they can take multiple AP and college classes without getting burnt out- but they all are also carrying their own struggles and burdens.

why can't i be better? people have it worse than me, yet i'm laying in bed for 5 hours when i come home from school, feeling too exhausted. i can't get myself to say i'm depressed because i feel like i don't have it BAD like some people do. my ""depression"" is just me not being able to focus on a class lecture for more than 30 minutes and coming home and being too tired to do any homework. i'm not deserving of being ""depressed"".

i feel like i can only be properly deserving of having depression if i cut/burn myself. i'd done it only 3 or 4 times in my life, but i didn't get any gratification from it. now, i feel like doing it would be a justification of my mental illness and prove that i am depressed.

i don't really think this made coherent sense. i don't really know what i'm doing here, or with my life honestly. i'm too scared to kms because of deep-rooted religious fear. i'm too scared to harm myself because it hurts. but i feel like it's the only way to justify what i am.",2,2025-01-31 04:49:14,1,1.0,Repulsive_Chemist536

depression,1ie9clm,What should be the way to go forward?,"Hello Guys

I have a very close friend whom I’ve found out she has been having episodes of depression.

She did not want to tell me and I am sure she has her reasons, I am not the most empathetic by nature and have very dark and a sarcastic humor. She has told me sometimes personal things and I will throw in a sarcastic comment there, unfortunately I don’t know how to respond to serious situations like normal people.

I do know she had her own reasons for not telling me as she mentioned that she was advised to tell me by a friend of hers that she told. That’s when she told me.

When she sent me a voice note I responded, thank you so much for telling me and I’m so sorry you are going through this. I never mentioned it again, I believe since she didn’t wanna tell me, I will wait for her to bring it up if she wants to talk about it and I treat her normally as if she’s not suffering from anything basically the same way we were before this.

She then told her friend that I am acting weird towards her which I am not sure how. My question is what is the best way for me to go on without hurting her? Like I said I’m not the best when it comes to serious issues. Or was I supposed to react differently.

Your help will be very helpful. Thank you ",1,2025-01-31 08:14:15,0,1.0,Spiritual-Storage-87

depression,1ie58zi,Been feeling really down,"Emotionally, physically, and mentally, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. I got dumped, and it was my first relationship—I went into it not fully understanding what was acceptable and what wasn’t. Looking back, it was filled with emotional and mental abuse, and I didn’t even realize how much it was breaking me down until it was too late. Now, I feel drained, like she took everything out of me and left me empty.

Before this relationship, I was in the best shape of my life. I was strong, confident, and had a clear sense of who I was. But now, when I look in the mirror, I barely recognize myself. All I’m left with are emotional scars, a broken heart, and a chronic disc injury that has taken away the one thing I loved most—weightlifting.

Sometimes, I think about how different things would be if I had never been in that relationship. If I hadn’t ignored the red flags, if I hadn’t been helping her move furniture that day, maybe my back would still be fine. But I don’t want to sit here blaming her—the only person I can hold accountable is myself for overlooking the signs and staying when I should have walked away.

This whole situation has been weighing on me heavily, and mentally, it’s been really tough. I haven’t talked to anyone about it, but the truth is, I’ve been feeling so down. It’s like no matter how much time passes, the emotions still hit me hard. I keep replaying everything in my head—what happened, what I should have seen earlier, what I could have done differently.

I didn’t realize how much this relationship was taking from me while I was in it, but now that it’s over, I feel the full weight of it.

I feel like an alien trying to exist in a world full of normies. Something is wrong. I spend every waking moment trying to please everyone around me. I have never been good enough. I don’t know how to socialize. I want to run away. Like to the end of the earth. And just die in a hole. In solitude. I give up. ,70,2025-01-30 08:17:53,11,1.0,Aggressive_Net997
depression,1ie8796,I feel like a bad partner,"Me and my partner have been together for a year now, we are long distance and in this one year they clearly struggled with their mental health from day to day, some days are better than the other and I just loved them through it all.

In our relationship they once had a very bad depressive episode, it lasted two weeks or maybe a little more and they slowly spiraled in front of my eyes and I really couldn’t help with anything because we were less than 6 months in and I never dated someone who struggled with depression.

In the end they ghosted me for a couple days, but then slowly came back and went back to normal, they cleaned their room and went out and we had deep talks about that period and what we both felt but couldn’t communicate back then, it was such an important period in our relationship because it made us trust each other more and learn new ways to love each other.

I used to think that if this ever happens again, I’ll be ready, I will know what to do or say and I’ll be able to support my partner the right way.

Well it is happening again right now and I feel just as lost, it started small with a small argument then our schedules didn’t match for a minute and I started noticing the signs, they’re constantly feeling lost, no positive look on the future, a lot of suicide jokes that don’t sound like jokes, asking for more alone time, having hard time with sleep, anxious about everything and nothing and a lot more.

At first I tried implementing what I know, gave them their space and kept reminding them I love them, it felt like they started floating away from me, we don’t have talks or laughs anymore, I barely know what they’re doing or what happened today at work or how’s the dogs doing, just surface level stuff.

I tried communicating that I miss them, want to spend more time together, tried to work on my schedule to get more free time to spend with them, it just doesn’t feel the same, and it makes me anxious to be around the person I love and feel awkward and stressed.

The last couple of days every chance we got to talk it’ll end up turning to basically me crying about how much I miss them and asking them to tell me what’s wrong or what do they need help with and them telling me they don’t know and apologizing.

I know what I’m doing is not right but I don’t know what else to do, today I tried giving them some tough love I guess by pointing out that something they said is something they said last time before spiraling completely and told them that they really need to break the cycle before it gets worse and that I love and care about them and don’t want it to get worse for them.

I don’t know if what I’m doing is right, I don’t even know what would be right, I don’t like talking to people irl about this because I feel like my partner’s mental health is our business and don’t want them to view my partner as a sick person, so I’m turning to Reddit for advice.

If you struggle with depression, how would you like your partner to help ? Especially if they’re far from you and can only text or call, please point out if I did something good or bad I just need all the feedback I can get.",1,2025-01-31 06:54:39,0,1.0,throwin-awayaccountt

depression,1ie84st,Is it even worth it to keep going?,"TW: mentions of suicidal ideation, self harm, abandonment, death

Just as the title says, I have recently been caught self harming by two of my friends who have taken all my sharps but I’ve still been spiraling, It’s gotten to the point where tomorrow I plan to go to the top of a parking garage on campus and see where fate takes me.

This spiral started because of the election results which has led to many targets towards my identity and my mental state getting even worse based on the events within the US. Now that I’m getting worse again all that fills my head is thoughts along the lines of what if this car hits me, what if I cut off my hand, etc. Once I’m in a location where I can’t immediately hurt myself I’m just left to think that bc I just started college, all the fun ppl I’ve met will graduate before me and I’m gonna be left all alone like I always end up in life so why not just end it now. If I’m not alive I don’t have to deal with the pain of people leaving me for the god knows how many times. This thought process is also applying to the ppl and pets in my life bc I don’t have the best relationship with mortality and many around me have died (10 pets, 3 family members) all over 12 years and I’m scared because my family is only getting older, same with my current pets and I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle the pain of losing them, so why not just end it.

I think part of me still wants to live but I see no point in continuing to live nor do I even see any value in myself to show why I should keep going

Sorry if this made no sense, I’m just at the edge and have very little space in my brain left for coherent thought. ",1,2025-01-31 06:50:18,0,1.0,throwaway68262

My voice dissolves in empty air.
You smile at screens, at flickering light,
But never me—not in the night.

The vows we swore, the dreams we spun,
Unraveled threads, one by one.
Your hands once warm, now cold, withdrawn,
I reach for you—you’re already gone.

A stranger’s wife, a nameless face.

depression,1ie3i8h,i'm doing it to myself,"i've been feeling down since july, and i've mainly been able to deal with it along with the help of lexapro, but these last few days have been brutal. i've been coming off of a case of norovirus, but i don't think that's a big part of it. just something that sucks.

these past few months i always have these lofty dreams of finally starting to improve myself, finally starting to do the things i want, and i envision this perfect version of myself that is fun, social, attractive, and happy. and for those few daydreaming moments i feel at peace & optimistic. sometimes if i feel really motivated, then i'll even do something way out of my comfort zone like calling someone or going to the gym. but usually a couple minutes later it comes crashing back down to reality - just sad and alone and locked in my room and realizing that every time i DO start to improve myself, i eventually just return back to the baseline.

i convince myself that nothing will change and that i'll get more and more depressed, and eventually off myself. it's a terrifying thought but there's times where that seems like the only reasonable outcome, knowing my track record with refusing to change.

i'm nineteen in college. i got diagnosed with gad and social anxiety, along with an unspecified depressive disorder. it sucks being in college because all around me i see people who seem to have a bunch of close friends, and are always out and doing something, and always have something interesting to say. and i've only made a couple friends who i really don't see that often.

i'm in my room 90% of my day. i'll go to class, come back and spend hours in my room, maybe go to the library if i need to, and then spend the rest of the day in my room. i only eat food in my room. it's miserable. i just want to be normal and social, but i have no idea where to start. i hate the idea of the gym because it's always crazy busy, even really early or late. i don't like going to the dining halls by myself because i'm worried people think i'm a loser (i know it's stupid but i just can't shake it). clubs seem to have a pre-established friend group in each one of them, and it's also really awkward to go to those by myself. 

i know that the only fix for how awful and miserable i feel is to just get out of my room and go do something. but for whatever reason i won't do it. i'll just bask in my misery and discomfort instead, and spiral into a deeper and darker place.

i just always feel judged when i'm outside of my room. i've always hated the way that i look, i'm super underweight (it's really been hard to eat when i feel depressed), i have awful posture, and i'm usually always walking alone. i know that nobody gives a shit, but for whatever reason i'm just so worried that people are judging me.

i just keep shooting myself in the foot, and keep getting in my own head about stupid things. i wish i could just be normal socially, i wish i could have more self-confidence in the way that i look, i wish i had more friends and didn't shut myself off to people, and i wish that i could start improving myself and actually stick to it long-term.

i'm just kind of ranting, not really looking for advice, but i'll take it if given. thanks for reading",2,2025-01-31 02:36:42,0,1.0,carbonated_6

depression,1ie0ezg,I wish I wasn't born,"Everyday I wake up and wish that something will happen to me. I am passionless and I have no purpose in this life. Just a bit of a story, I was homeless almost all my life. This made me anxious of spending money due to the fact that I didn't want to be homeless again. I was able to get into college and graduated with a bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering. You might think wow that's awesome but I felt nothing. It was just another tasks done. I just thought this is a good job that will make me money so that I don't go back to where I was.  Then my depression went downhill after applying for job after job and not getting a single one. I had no job, no car, no house was living in a room with my mother. I felt awful  and I was the most suicidal during those days. 

After a year, I was able to get a drivers license and got a cheap car and started working as a gig worker since that was the only job I was accepted at, not even Walmart wanted me. After working for a while I was able to get an apartment. Great now you have a car, a job, an apartment but I still feel horrible. I felt like I could've done more. My mother convinced me to go to graduate school because maybe I will get more opportunities in jobs. Well here I am on my second semester of my masters program and I feel impotent. I feel like I don't know nothing. I can't problem solve and I can't even present well. I don't even know how I got admitted to a graduate program in the first place.

I dread everyday I feel like I know once I graduate from my masters, I'll probably won't get a job either and i'll end up in square one and probably end up homeless again. I hate my program because I am not passionate about engineering but even if I quit what will i even do? I don't have another option or a dream I can persuade. I have nothing going for me. And to add to this I am in $52k in debt because of loans and credit cards. I know there are people out there with worse life's than mine but I can't seem to find happiness in what I already have.

depression,1ie7aja,I can’t anymore,"I have just woken up , slept at around 4:30 last night ik it in the morning and what was the point of sleeping m but I did . And I prayed last night to god to make the night stay and never let it pass . There was some peace that at this hour I can cry as much as I want but when I’ll wake up I’ll be judged for doing something so small that is my escape . My brain is hurting rn I want to sleep for ever and never wake up , never think , never talk to anyone and feel as if everyone is against me , never overthink ever little think , how somebody said hi to me in which tone , how they responded to my vulnerabilities . I want to move far beyond this . 
Last night a lot happened . I contemplated overdosing , committing a suicide . This should not be happening right now I’m at a very crucial point in my life where what I do now determines my life but I  do not even feel for that anymore . I study , a lot but it’s my escape as I know when I’ll have nothing to do , my brain will destroy me . How to control all of this ? Idk I have tried seriously a lot to think of a counter thought when it strikes but I haven’t been progressing at all.
Yesterday , I heard Liz say to treat your inner child the way you would your own child , I believe in the philosphy of treating yourself the way you yourself want to be treated . But I feel betrayed , disrespected everywhere . I make a friend , I lose my sense of self , start treating them as the most important one , stand up for them even when I need help the most but I never ask for it . At the end of, it’s me who is the one to blame for everything. I’m tired tof people . can’t trust anyone anymore . I wish to have the superpower to turn off my brain just for 2 mins . 
Yesterday ,  a lady died in my neighbourhood and all I was thinking was the peace that she was feeling even though she was not , she was not alive to feel it . I wish I could overdose on sleeping pills and never wake up just never and I would have the excuse as well that she couldn’t help it as she is not wise enough on how much dose to take , I’ll go far far away where nobody will judge me , I’ll be over analyzing every bit of my life and there will be peace around . 
It’s very loud where my mind is , very loud . While writing this , my head is hurting , I can feel a knot in my throat building up . But I won’t cry , I don’t have the energy left , did a lot last night . 
I want to treat myself the way I treat others , I know I have a lot of good in me that I can see good through others but I can’t help but talk shit about me . From self deprecating humor to under-testing
 my potential when ever I’m doing it , there is a voice in my head telling me to stop and say something good about myself but the contrary voice to it overpowers . 
I’m tired of people giving me advices , I know already what they have to say , “look out , see the world , be happy , get a hobby “. I’m
Very tired of everything . Nothing has any essence left for me to give me peace . Nothing . 
I hurt a lot,very much, to the point that  my chest starts hurting , forehead starts hurting, I get a headache and then I do my good ol crying . But the thing that hurt me , no matter how much words I have , I cannot express it fully to other people and always , always end up saying sorry . I’m envious of those who are confident , envious of those who are always saying good things about themselves . And then comes me who gets treated as a doormat why? Just because I gave “them” way too much , showed way too much, was with them whenever they wanted me, they told me not to sleep tonight and talk , did it . But who is the one who is weak and will get fixed soon ? Me . The last thing you should say to someone going through all of this is “I’ll fix you “ “ ill show you how to live life “ “do this , do that , you don’t know anything , do something “ this attitude  even though ,might be coming from a place of care but saying this to one going through this brings them down in their own eyes . Makes them feel a dependent . 
Liz fixed herself , I have never respected a stranger this much but Aurora is not able to , she is breathing but dead . I which I could kill Aurora without thinking of anyone . They will forget about me once I go ,after some years . And even if they won’t why do I care ? I asked for help , I ,for sure did ,but now , I can’t anymore , I don’t want to . Neither I have the energy nor the will to . 
Life is very beautiful without people with just nature , kids , cats and puppies around . Such innocence these people hold , they won’t judge you , will say and do whatever they’ll have on my mind ..god has to make me this independent so that I afford to go to an orphanage , old age home and see the cruelty in this world thrashed upon some people . Go far away from those who take advantage of other’s innocence just for their desires which only them and god knows what are and why are . Tears are running down my face , but I don’t feel anything , nothing . I am scared of everything , everyperson . I can’t stand someone even harsh up their tone against me . Why? Idk coz I don’t do it and whenever they do I get restless , very restless , short of breath and I lose my ground . I’m not ready to face the world , I want to escape this world and live around old people , children , dogs , cats , puppies , kittens with lots of chocolates , meadows , waterfalls , streams , greeneries , in the woods where there is no trace of other human .
I do not need anyone , I don’t want myself , my brain as I’m already dead . Already . And no one can “fix” me now . If someone will come close to me I won’t let them . This is all that will happen . I can’t trust anyone no matter how much I try , I really do try a lot to look someone in different light but I get defeated by my thoughts. This inferiority will never go away so I want to escape myself in children . Stay with them all the time , play with them and be at peace . This is the only thing that will give me peace of mind I feel . I want to change my brain like we do our clothes. . I don’t care anymore .

I know there are much bigger problems in life, but for some reason I cannot cope this time. I'm not suicidal, but feel like if I die, it would be such a relief.

depression,1idv5gl,Failed suicide attempts. The endless loop,"

I attempted suicide probably five times in my life (im 37), and after each one, life just gets worse. I’m glad for people that it gets better for them, but it’s the exact opposite with me.

It’s getting worse especially lately. Its like you’re stuck in a loop: failed attempt, life and health is worse, so it makes you want to end it more now because you cant handle the pain.

My best friend of many years cut me off lately and I’m to blame, and the guilt is killing me and its making me feel like a failure. I miss her and I worry about her.

The feeling of guilt to fail a loved one is one of the worst feelings ever, and if you suffer from depression, its hell on earth. 

I’m even shopping for a nitrogen tank. Today I stood in the middle of the street hoping someone just obliterate me. I’m alone, I’m transgender, and I have no one. My best friend was always there for me, and now she’s gone and I don’t blame her.

depression,1ie6drj,I feel like my mom doesn't care about my pain,"So today, I had a triggering incident regarding looking up how to get an extension on my unemployment benefits, so I texted my mom to call me ASAP, and I told her what was ailing me and that I was not only considering robbing a bank to ease my financial woes, but failing that, that I was also going to take all of my pills at once. In regards to the former, she said that I would fuck up my chances of ever getting a job, and in regards to the latter, she said that I might not die, but that I might become a human vegetable and cause pain to my family either way. I know that everything is temporary, but I've become so fed up waiting to get a good job that will pay me decent money that I feel like my mom doesn't even care about my own pain.

I had my own successful MMA/Personal Training business at the age of 23-24. Had a freak accident/injury, which has disabled me. I had to close my whole business down because of it. Lost all my hard earned money on doctor’s appointments, a failed surgery, and moving states with complex regional pain syndrome. Don’t even get me started on that. Explaining what CRPS is to a regular person is like trying to teach rocket science to a dog. Nobody listens and accepts what you tell them is going on with you. Even doctors. I’m 25 yrs old. 

I can’t walk. I had to start a whole new business from scratch again and put on another fake smile. Still got bills to pay. No friends because who wants to be friends with a disabled person? After all I’ve given to these people. They don’t give back when I need them most. 

Many years ago before I even became disabled, I struggled with depression, meds, drinking, suicidal thoughts every single day, dreadful loneliness for 8 years, health problems at a young age, people looking down on me for no reason, etc. 

All I have to say is if you have depression, I truly understand. But if you have two feet that work fine with no pain, be grateful.

depression,1ie0xic,Not depressed but a lack of motivation,"Hi y'all. 

I've recently come to terms that I may be a bit depressed. Just a tad bit. I believe it comes from having a lack of social circle. My only true social circles are my family and coworkers. When I'm not at home, I'm at work. When I'm not at work I'm at home.

I guess I'm writing this to kind of fill in the blanks for myself. If it helps another person then great. I haven't dated for a while now and I believe that is one that I should really working towards. I have just recently been able to continue my education and I want that to also be a continuing part of my life. 

I don't know. In times I've found that being idle has made me depressed. When some may find being in bed mindlessly playing video games for hours can distract or at least find some enjoyment in that. I can not. I can certainly play video games for hours or even watch anime for hours but I find myself very very sick at the end of it. Some what brain fried or drained.

When I actually try to partake in things I like. Medicine and other things, car mechanic, I feel a bit lost at the moment. Just very lost. I find myself questioning do I actually like this? Do I actually want this. And in reality I do. I know I do but I just can't get that through to myself. I find myself unmotivated and end up doing nothing at all. Just patiently letting the time go by. Some times I find that when I'm on opioids I feel better about myself. When on pain killers I feel more free or at least happy. But I don't really do anything. 

Its such an odd feeling. I don't quite like it. This sudden dread. I may need to change my outfit or something. Make it brighter or something. I have in the past but have just gone back to black clothing because its easier on my choices and I quite like it. I don't know. Its just bizarre to myself. 

I have it in my mind that I want to study. I want to work out. But at the same time something stops me. I envy people that can just do it. I have a wall in my apartment that I've half painted and haven't finished painting but I just can't bring myself to move the furniture to actually do it. I've said it before that ""the best thing you could do, is just do it.""  I don't know what it is. I could very much be sick of everything. ",2,2025-01-31 00:32:43,0,1.0,Dependent-Place3707
depression,1ie5exv,How to tell my friends I’m struggling when we lost someone to suicide?,"Repost into a different subreddit 

So I’ve been struggling with being vaguely actively suicidal for the last idk 4 months, previously just passively suicidal for like, my whole life tbh but that’s another ordeal. 2 of my housemates know and I’m planning to tell the others sometime soon. 

But I saw a practitioner today who recommended I tell my other close friends who I hang out with more frequently, (ive also spoken to my housemates who know since and they agree) the only issue is - we lost a friend to suicide may last year, so not even a full year ago. I’m not really sure if it’s a good idea because of that? 

I don’t want to trigger them because it would be quite upsetting and I don’t know if it’s like that much of a risk to worry them in that way. One of these friends spoke to me once about the friend who we’ve lost, he lived with him, and said that he wish he had known that he was struggling at least so he could keep an eye out. But yeah I’m really not sure it’s a good idea. 

Also if I were to do it - how do you even start that conversation??? Like I can’t just be like ‘hey besties guess what! I wanna kill myself’ that’s very not chill. How would be the best way to go about telling them? Being both gentle but getting the message across

depression,1ie4q7z,I feel like it’s way too late for me for anything at this point.,"I’m almost 26F. I am NOT exaggerating in the SLIGHTEST when I say I’ve never really had friends. A lot of people say they’ve never had friends, but I’ve noticed those people actually do have friends, but maybe for some reason they feel like they don’t. But a lot of these people DO have actual friends to hang out with and do things with, and I see these same people like this in photos all the time with friends. But I never truly had many friends. I’ve only ever had two best friends, and I haven’t even spoke to them or seen them in years now. They’ve all grown up and now have families and lives of their own. You would NEVER find me in many photos, because well… I genuinely haven’t many experiences and friends TO be in photos with. That’s what my life has come to at almost 26. I’ve NEVER even partied. EVER. I struggle with making friends and keeping friends because of social anxiety and stuff like procrastination. I never even know what to say often times which is so stupid of me. I never have interesting to say. I feel like I’m not funny. I feel like I’m too boring and have NOTHING of value to add in a friendship. I feel like a waste of time and space. I’m not quick witted, I feel like my overall personality is so. Damn. Boring. And I’m not getting any younger. My youth is pretty much OVER at this point. I legitimately cannot look back and reflect on all the memories of partying and other crazy memories I’ve had, because I have NONE. In the future, I won’t have any fun and interesting stories to tell. There won’t be many photos of young me. There won’t be many photos of me and friends together. And even if I were to suddenly turn my life around over night and make more friends and do stuff, it would STILL be too late for me. I’m almost 26. Most people don’t even consider that young anymore. Not even a young adult, just an adult. I may as well be old and past my prime. I may as well just say eff it and give up. Like, just be honest with me and say that yes, it IS too late for me. It would be so lame and sad if I were suddenly start partying and doing crazy things in my 30s, which is when most people are settled down with families and way past their partying and youthful years. It would be so lame to look back and reflect and say something like “I did a lot of crazy things and partying in my 30s!” Instead of my 20s. Most people would be like “Wait… in your… 30s?!” Like it would be such a shock. When people tell stories of all the partying and crazy things they did, it’s almost always about their teen years and 20s. Not… 30s. I have never even traveled because I’m poor. I know I should just stop even trying at this point. I should just accept that this is my life and WILL be my life. That my life will always seem so… empty and boring. Devoid of any memories with friends or anything. But damn, it hurts. It hurts bad. I’m so damn lonely. But I should just accept it. My youth is over. I’m not young anymore. I never even had the confidence to wear what I truly want, and all the styles and aesthetics I truly love are more aimed at teens-early 20s, so there goes that as well. I’d just be trying to be someone I’m not if I were to finally start dressing how truly I want. (Like late 2000s-early 2010s scene/emo fashion with J-fashion inspo, and some other styles as well but it’s too many to go through). I’m sick of wearing the same clothes that don’t even feel like… me. But I’m so scared of getting judged and harassed and bullied for my clothing too, because you know social anxiety and fear.

depression,1idu294,I know what my problem is.,"My issue is that my mind is dominated by cynicism, nihilism, and ocd thought patterns that stay stuck on ideas and concepts related to death.

These issues are exacerbated by the fact that I’ve barely interacted with the world for over 8 years and have developed intense slothful coping mechanisms like constant entertainment binging so my mind can never fully confront myself and my issues. 

These issues are heavily enabled and have been enabled for so long because those supporting me don’t understand how to actually help in a way that isn’t enabling these bad traits of mine and out of a fear of change and the world at large I don’t help them to learn.

I have moments of clarity like this where I know I desperately need change, but they fade fast as I re-enter a state of mind fog by resuming my unchanging routine of mindlessly numbing myself with entertainment binging or on a rare occasion a substance to stave off any acknowledgement of my situation.

I don’t have health insurance or money to seek any sort of professional help. I wasted my entire 20’s hiding from the world and have almost zero skills at 30 and have lost or burnt all my bridges with friends.

I’m horribly alone with very little tools and a strong fear of others.  I’ve grown to hate myself, others, and everything around me.

depression,1ie49jj,I’m lost,"
I F22 feel completely lost—I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing here anymore. Since I was around 13, I’ve had this deep feeling that I wouldn’t live long, and now it feels like my life has no meaning. Everything I do seems to serve no real purpose other than keeping me occupied for the time being. My biggest struggle is with my parents—I feel trapped in this house. Don’t get me wrong, I truly love and appreciate them for everything they’ve done for me, but I’ve let them down too many times. At this point, everyone just sees me as a failure, and honestly, I see myself that way too. They hold incredibly strict standards for me, just because I’m a woman. Even though I’m the youngest, I’m expected to take care of the house, cook, and look after everyone and everything in it. And if I’m busy with my studies? That doesn’t matter. They occasionally hit me—slapping or beating me if I talk back, stay out late, or do things they disapprove of, like drinking or having a boyfriend. They’ve made it very clear that having a boyfriend is not allowed because “we don’t do that in our culture.” Instead, I’m expected to have an arranged (though not forced) marriage with a man from our religion and country, just like my parents and brother did. But I don’t want that. I grew up in North America, and I don’t share the same values or beliefs as people from my family’s home country. I don’t want to get married for that reason, and it makes me feel guilty toward my current boyfriend because, deep down, I know it will never be him. My parents would never accept him because of his skin color.

Another issue is drinking. I drink occasionally—I enjoy having drinks and THC with my friends, going to bars, partying, and just experiencing what it feels like to be a normal person in their 20s. But my mom recently found a beer can in my room, and now she says she’s failed as a mother, that I’m a horrible daughter, and that if I continue these “disgusting” behaviors, she will take her own life. Drinking isn’t even inherently bad, but because I’m a woman, I’m seen as a disgrace—yet when my brother does it, it’s fine. Academically, I’ve struggled too. I started college in 2020, but due to my own mistakes and diagnosed depression, I was eventually kicked out for not meeting the required GPA. My parents have never let me move on from that—they’ve never supported me, only made me feel ashamed and like a complete failure. I did go back to college and am now pursuing a new career path in chemical engineering. I’ve been doing really well—even making the Dean’s List—but in their eyes, I’m already too old, I failed once, and nothing I do will ever be good enough.

I know what many people would say: “Just move out and live your best life.” But that’s not an option for me right now. I’m not financially stable enough, and realistically, I won’t be for a few more years until I graduate and find a stable job. Plus, in my culture, it’s not normal for a child to move out, even after marriage—we’re expected to stay together as one big “happy” family. I also know that once I do move out, I will lose my entire family. They will disown me, and I will never see them again. And that thought hurts more than anything. Because at the end of the day, despite everything, they are my parents. I love them deeply, and they’ve given me everything I could ask for—except the freedom to be myself. I’m simply not the daughter they wanted, and I know I never will be. I don’t know what to do. All I know is that I will never truly be happy. Even if I move out and try to build a life for myself, I will always ache for my family.

I gave him chance after chance after chance. You can’t love someone and do the worst things you can think of in a relationship to them. I feel so stupid.

I am so broken. I’m grieving the sweet boy I once knew, who would never hurt me.

Why do I miss him even though he has hurt me more than anyone before. Why do I hope he keeps trying to earn me back. Why did I forgive him every time. Why does this hurt more than the actions he did.

I will never be the same. I never connected with someone so fast and so deeply.

depression,1ie41vu,Parei de fumar maconha e entrei em depressão profunda.,"Boa noite, quero fazer um desabafo.
Tenho 25 anos, sou formada em Letras Português e Inglês e estou me formando em Tecnólogo de Design Gráfico junto a um curso na mesma área, tudo bancado pela minha mãe, que é uma santa por me suportar e me bancar até hoje.
Mesmo com meus estudos, tudo que consegui foi um estágio na qual recebo 780,00 mensal para fazer diversos cards, comunicados, guias, videos, etc, sabemos que no Brasil esse valor é como se fosse 50,00.
Desde os 16 eu fumava maconha. Sempre fui uma pessoa extremamente tímida, com dificuldade intensa de socializar e fazer amigos. Sou filha única, e fui criada em um bairro periférico onde a maioria das crianças da minha idade estavam envolvidas em problemas com tráfico e drogas, o que desincotajava minha mãe me deixar ter amigos, e a entendo.
Cresci, portanto, muito sozinha e meus problemas de socialização foram aumentando.
Tentei me envolver com diversos grupos para me sentir aceita: rockeiros, LGBTs, e, por último, usuário de drogas. Esses dois últimos grupos me acolheram muito bem.
Dos 16 anos pra cá fui me envolvendo socialmente com alguns outros tipos de drogas, como MD que usei 2x e LSD que usei de 5 a 10 vezes, não me lembro, mas o que eu mais usava mesmo era a maconha, primeiro, socialmente, depois, no banheiro de casa e todos os dias, o vício foi piorando.
Em 2020 ocorreu a separação definitiva dos meus pais, o que pra mim foi uma benção, visto que meu pai traia e batia em minha mãe desde que me conheço por gente. Minha mãe e eu, saímos ""foragidas"" do meu pai para Brasília, pois o mesmo vivia sob efeito de Cocaína e Álcool.
Novamente minha dificuldade em fazer amigos mostrou as caras, agravada pela Pandemia. 
Antes de me mudar, eu havia conhecido uma garota na praia no Ano Novo e comecei a me relacionar com ela.
Dado o momento de solidão, comecei buscar meios de trazer essa garota para Brasília para morar comigo, consegui diversos empregos em diversas áreas, alguns em situações complicadas, como o Estacionamento sem banheiro na qual eu trabalhei, onde precisava urinar no chão do terreno ao lado, correndo o risco de ser pêga numa situação constrangedora pelo dono ou caseiro do local.
Meses se passaram e consegui, junto com a ajuda da minha mãe (de novo) e do meu padastro, alugar um apartamento e juntar dinheiro para que ela viesse morar comigo, gastamos todas as nossas economias e conseguimos.
Essa garota, era ainda mais viciada em drogas do que eu, já tinha usado vários tipos, seus preferidos eram LSD (que usamos juntas umas 2 vezes) e maconha, que usávamos juntas sempre.
2 anos se passaram na rotina de trabalhar e viver juntas, sempre fumando muito, diariamente e praticamente o dia inteiro, se tornou algo normal pra mim como ir ao banheiro e até mais normal do que tomar água. Após diversas confusões que nos enfiamos em momentos de crise, decidimos voltar para São Paulo onde nos sentíamos melhor e tínhamos mais amigos para contar, não viveríamos presas uma a outra.
Voltamos em 2022 e tudo continuou igual, agora com inclusão de amigos, também viciados. 
Minha mãe me ajudou a comprar equipamentos para começar um projeto de Estamparia e eu voltei a ter vontade de crescer. Mas, eu queria que quem estava comigo crescesse também.
Ela começou querer tatuar, fiquei feliz dela ter a iniciativa de querer fazer algo pois isso não era comum. Comprei todo o kit de tatuagem para que ela começasse e sempre a incentivava a desenhar e treinar em seus equipamentos, o que depois ela começou dizer que era uma ""pressão"" e parou, desistiu, e entregou seus equipamentos para sua irmã de 12 anos começar a treinar.
Uns 2 anos depois, ela informou que queria fazer faculdade de psicologia e tinha visto uma bolsa, novamente eu fiquei feliz, pois ela sempre falava de psicologia e o quanto gostava e novamente tive a esperança dela crescer comigo. Ela pediu a minha ajuda para realizar a prova da bolsa e eu, é claro, concordei.
O dia passou e na manhã eu perguntei se a gente poderia fazer a prova, ela disse que não queria, e isso se repetiu por semanas até que ela perdesse o prazo da prova que eu iria fazer pra ela e só precisava que ela estivesse ao meu lado e minimamente sóbria para querer dar esse passo, o que não ocorreu.
Muitas outras coisas aconteceram e me envolvi em terapias que me fizeram notar que minha repulsa por homens vinha do meu pai e da relação que eu e minha mãe tínhamos com ele, o que me trouxe uma curiosidade sobre como seria a experiência de ter algo com um homem, visto que nunca havia tido e a relação estava péssima e desgastada com muitas brigas e minha vontade incessante de abandonar as drogas enquanto minha parceira militava o quanto fumar era essencial para a vida dela (até mais do que eu).
Decidi mudar de vida! 
Terminei meu relacionamento e me mudei para outra cidade, distante de todos novamente, para que pudesse recomeçar do 0 e do jeito certo, sem nenhum envolvimento com drogas, trouxe comigo meus materiais de estamparia, minha cama e os meus gatos. 
Cá estou eu hoje, limpa a quase 2 meses, porém numa depressão profunda que não me abandona. O sentimento de inutilidade, de não ter cultivado boas relações, até mesmo de amizade, de apenas gastar o dinheiro da minha mãe, de ter gasto tanto tempo da minha vida me envolvendo com coisas e pessoas erradas, de não ter progredido significativamente em tanto tempo, a contínua dificuldade de socializar e encontrar amigos, principalmente mantê-los, a vontade incessante de fumar para ver se sinto um alívio de serotonina e dopamina no meu cérebro que estão totalmente desregulados, uma incessante vontade de me matar que me acompanha todos os dias e a maior parte do dia, o que não faço apenas por amor à minha mãe, mas que tenho certeza que o dia que ela, Deus me livre, fechar os olhos, eu fecho em seguida.
Isso foi um desabafo de uma pessoa desesperada e eu espero que ajude quem ler até aqui a entender que: drogas, por mais legal que pareçam ser, será a pior coisa que você poderá fazer para você mesmo.",1,2025-01-31 03:02:05,0,1.0,brunap27
depression,1idw06m,The Weight of The World,"Ever felt like sometimes things become too overwhelming for you, even when you’re at ease? No pressure, no nothing, just a sudden gush of “i don’t feel like i deserve what’s happening to me right now-ie; spending time with all of your family members, eating a wide spread of good food, doing your favorite things, hanging out with your closest friends?

Yeah, I feel that everytime when something good is taking place. For instance, I was having a shitty week and all of a sudden, when Saturday comes, and your friends/family come by or they wanted to hang out with you, in that very brief moment, you feel like all your problems disappear, for a short while. For a second, I felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders, felt like the world was giving me a good back massage and I was truly enjoying it and then….Sunday arrived.

I, for one, am dealing with loneliness. It’s been a couple of years now since I got ditched by my ex, who left me for another guy. Ever since I became a single man, I have been spending a lot of time alone; I’d eat alone when I’m out, I’d go to the movies alone, I’d go shopping alone, in short, loneliness never left my side, I became good friends with loneliness. It was no longer a state of mind, It became a whole entity in itself. 

So much that I’d go looking for loneliness whenever I feel overwhelmed by getting surrounded by my family/friends. I’d isolate. I’d find a space somewhere, where I could be left alone for as long as possible, then I’d be at peace.

So the equation that I have arrived at is:

Abandonment + Loneliness = Hardship

Hardship + Survival = Accustom 

Hardship + Accustom = Comfort Zone

So, my comfort zone, as sad as it sounds, would be Loneliness.",3,2025-01-30 21:01:53,0,1.0,stoicistic_
depression,1ie3w5n,I’ve lost too much…,"Hi there, my name is Alvaro and I’m from Uruguay. 
I’m at a point in my life of not knowing what to do, so I think that’s why I’m writing this here. Medication, psychotherapy, nothing has worked and things are going maddeningly fast and wrong. 
I’m 33 years old, I’ve lost my job in a country where is really hard to have one. I lived the major part of 2024 in my parents house, my mother had a tough year, she was hospitalized several times and finally she passed away on October 27 of 2024 in the early morning. I was there with my father. After RCP for more than 20 minutes we couldn’t recuperate her. 
She was a big pillar for me, she is physically no more but I tend to think that she still lives in my memories. 
I have suffered of depression since I have reason. 
I suffer of bipolar disorder and BPD. Both disorders have been properly diagnosed. And there is surely a trauma because of what happened on 27th. 
I’m currently at the lowest point in my life, being the second lowest point October 26 (the day before my mother died). Things are not working. I’m stuck. I have some proper education, I can speak, write and read Spanish, English and German. I don’t have a University education though (having one doesn’t change the fact that in my country there are few opportunities). I feel I wasted my twenties doing many things and not finishing nothing, I did try to study for being an accountant but that failed. I feel im wasting my thirties now. 
I’m now in my house, it’s 10:56 pm here. It’s the only time I feel some “happiness”. The moment when I know that sleep is close and I’ll have eight hours of peace. 
Mornings are hell. The days are monotonous, I’m failing at finding a job, in fact I didn’t send any CVs this week. Waking up, to put both feet outside bed and on the ground are always a battle, sometimes a lost battle and I would wake up at 11 am wasting all the morning. 
I’m currently feeling lonely, I know that void and loneliness sentiments are part of BPD but I honestly think I’m alone this time. My relationship with my father is not very good. 
So, I don’t know how to finish this. I’m not thinking on ending my life. I know my mother would want me to keep going and I’ll do that first for myself and closely second for her. 
But I’m lost. I do not know which path to take. 
And I’m really scared. ",1,2025-01-31 02:55:04,0,1.0,Irwadary

depression,1ie3m8x,Transportation to another universe,"Why do I suddenly feel like I'm transported into another universe, without colors, taste or any pleasure like everything fading away? I keep telling myself it could get worse and I might not have the things and relationships I have now, like I have to be grateful for them. But thinking I could lose them makes me so much more depressed. Depression comes back just like an old song ringing in my ear, sucking all the colors, taste. And now I'm stuck in a black and white TV show which seems to never end and people in the back laugh and give creepy vibes. It goes and goes. 

Grief is almost the hardest thing for me to deal with and I chose poverty to study. What better topic I could find in terms of making my psychological health absolute shit? I mean I have no idea. Poverty is in and of itself not having something so it's directly related to grief. Why does this topic rip me and my heart fall apart? And why did I jump on something like this? I don't know. 

All the neglect, abandonment I had from my father and the emotional black hole it left in me. I'm in pain like I'm left here to bleeding to death, almost for my whole life. Once it crossed my mind to end it all with leaving a note to my story. Sometimes it feels so much, too much, I feel like I can't take it anymore and I'm gonna end it all. With just holding on to keep being alive most days, I don't have much to look forward to, which makes me not excited about the future. But if something happened I'm not sure I'd be happy, I feel an inherent darkness to most things, even my dreams. I also feel like I'd lose something I work on. For example, think you're pregnant and you're terrified of miscarriage the whole time. 

Also, fuck depression. When you've gone a very severe one, it comes back regardless how much input you're putting in. It sucks so much. I'm also hungry. I missed that, I'm gonna enjoy the sensation for a while, I'm out of options in my darkness and there are not many things left really helping me. Shit. 

People die in my country due to some idiotic neglect of fire alarms. It's crazy how easy it is to harm someone, like sometimes all you have to do is put one leg above the other and chill and think your God will take care of it all.

depression,1ie38tw,Dogs are making me increasingly depressed,"I’m at the end of my rope and feel so hopeless and helpless. I love my dogs but the issues are negatively impacting my mental health. I have 3 dogs and it’s hard. My ex got a puppy for my daughter and when the dog was 10 months he decided he didn’t want her any more. I took her, because I didn’t want to break my daughter’s heart, and regret that I didn’t say no. I already had 2 dogs. It’s a lot of work to care for 3 dogs but that’s not the issue. When the dog was 2 she started attacking one of the other dogs. At first the triggers were predictable and the fights were easily broken up. As time has gone by the triggers are getting more unpredictable and the fights worse. She’s a staffy and incredibly strong. To add my daughter goes to college 10 hours away and it’s just me with the dogs. Which is actually easier because one of the triggers is when my daughter comes and goes while home. They get separated for a bit that is no longer enough. Christmas we got home, kept them separated for a while until they were calm and the staffy attacked while the other dog was just walking by. 

Since the triggers have recently gotten more unpredictable I’m on edge constantly which no doubt doesn’t help the situation. I also hate leaving the house because of the fear that my coming and going will cause a problem, they are crated when I’m gone but the excitement when I get home is an issue.  

I’m crying all the time, feel like a prisoner and resent that I’m in this situation. I also feel guilt because apart from these fights the dog is incredibly sweet and has never shown any sign of aggression to me, the 15 year old male chihuahua or anyone else. Only our female pittie. 

I’ve reached out to different rescues and the only advice I’ve gotten is to surrender her to the municipal shelter. I know she wouldn’t do well in a shelter environment and I fear that they would euthanize due to aggression history. Also, my daughter would never forgive me. I couldn’t live with myself if that happened. She would be a great dog for an adult with no other animals but don’t know anyone. I’m just trapped, depressed, angry and don’t know how to get out of this without an incredible amount of guilt. I really can’t take living like this.

depression,1idv4vw,Half life Prozac,"
Hi all, 

I will start by saying I have an appt with my psychiatrist on Monday so I plan on asking him this same question but wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience:

I took 20mg of Prozac for 33 days, felt like 5-10% better while taking it but was experiencing the sexual side effects. So I stopped taking it (confirmed with doctor this was okay), then 2 days later I felt 100% better (like barely any depression or anxiety) and that lasted for ~10 days. But I’m back to square 1 and that 100% feeling is gone. Is it possible that Prozac was still in my system for those 10 days since it has a long half life? And I stopped it just as it was starting to work?

Thanks for any responses I really appreciate it",3,2025-01-30 20:25:42,1,1.0,AntiqueRub1256
depression,1ie33ft,I hate my friends,"I know it's a harsh title, but this is how i currently feel. 
All of the ""friends"" i have just keep making me worse, i don't know why i'm a magnet for assholes and weirdos in general. 
Not even the cool or nice type of weirdos, just creepy people.

I'm always so surprised when i meet actually nice people, like the lovely guy who owns the bakery with his wife, my sister's boyfriend who is cool as hell. I've never really met people like that. I never met people who are actually genuinely nice to me,  they always end up (quite literally) stealing stuff from me, talking shit about me behind my back, or just use me in general. 

I know i'm not perfect either! I get that, NO ONE is perfect, and that's fine! But i'm SO tired of being used and hurt by everyone, over and over again.

One of my current friends (who is also one of the reasons why i'm making this post) is living with me and my mom right now. We gave her everything, she had to basically escape from her current living situation so we gave her a room and a bed, her own bathroom etc, i gave her all my love. 

And she ends up stealing money from my mom several times, and when we confronted her she lied and said she never even was in my mom's room.

And i still forgave her, and honestly i feel like that's one of the many reasons why i always end up with people like that. I always forgive.

She came home a few days ago crying, she got in an awful situation with some people while being drunk. 
I remember opening the door for her because she couldn't even put the keys in. 
I know it sounds horrible, but second i looked at her i just thought ""You need to move out"" 
I obviously didn't say that, she needed me the most in that moment. 
I know that whatever happened to her was (obviously) not her choice like when she stole from us. 
It doesn't have anything to do with her actually, but this situation just showed the current state again. 

She abuses my trust and a short time later i have to comfort her. 
I'm so tired of this.
It's not the first time, back to that moment when i had to pay like 500 Franks to an uber because a guy i knew and liked back then threw up in the car, i brought home home safely despite having a panic attack while his other friend literally just left us by ourselves. 

I never got a ""thank you"" or at least a bit of the money back.
Our ""friendship"" wasn't even really a friendship, he'd basically just meet up with me to proudly tell me how much weed he smoked while drinking alcohol. 

And i've always just had friends like that. 
I ENVY people who have like 3 close people they know. I have one person i see like once a year and i often catch myself looking through their Whatsapp or Insta history, they usually chill at home or are at work, but once in a while i see them posting themselves with some of their friends. Not even like a romantisized version, just a casual hangout. But you can tell the vibe is good.
I actually invited this friend and one of his friends to go to a sort of Renfaire together. 
Seeing their friendship and what it means to actually like and trust each other broke me. 

It's not even that i don't try, i try so hard to be friends with people that are genuine and real, but we either lose contact for no reason or i always get pushed away. 
I've asked my friend a few times now if we wanna go to a comic con together, when they said that they're already with people i've asked if i can be with them.
I then got told it would br better if not bc they're too many people already. I say that i completely understand and maybe next time. 
Next time it's the same situation, either too many people, they have a group cosplay, or i simply get forgotten.

Which ends with me having to meet up with ""friends"" again where i first have to hide money and expensive stuff before they can enter the house because they'll 100% steal something again.

I feel like school times from like 2014-2019 where the only times i've met genuine people my age. 

The fact that getting robbed from my friends is like the least worse thing.

I've had people that i've cared for dearly that made fun of me in front of their other friends so they're the ""cool"" one, i've had friends that SA'd me, friends that ignored me, friends that told me i'm stupid and weird (and not in a funny way)

When i was like 13 and had a panic attack and my friend just left me on the street completely alone and afterwards sent me a message about ""What a bad friend and stupid bitch i am"" because i embarassed her in front of her boyfriend due to the panic attack.
I didn't recover from that for months, i was scared to go outside alone for weeks.

I never saw the bad in people, and i feel like that was one of my biggest mistakes.

That friend that i've stated at the beginning, who lives with us still, i can't stand that she's here.
I wanna tell her so bad to just pack her stuff and fucking leave. 
But she just experienced that horrible thing a few days ago and now i'm stuck again. Because if i told her to leave now i'd be the bad one. 

I'm fighting my depression and suicidal thoughts as much as i can, but i'm falling apart again.
I feel so uncomfortable with the people i have in my life right now.
It genuinely feels like tiny bugs crawling in my skin whenever i think about all the people i've let in my life. 

I thought about ending it all, just so i can escape all of this. I don't wanna live one more second with this woman i called my friend. I don't wanna see anyone i used to see. 
I know that simply ending the friendship would be easier, but it's not just that, it's all the internal wounds i have from all those things i've experienced. 

I apologize if i'm misusing a word here, but i'm traumatized by those people,  It has gotten to a point where my heart starts racing whenever i see people my age. Even worse when i have to meet them. Even before that situation with my roommate started, i was hanging out with my sister's friends (i'm 21, all of them are either pushing 40 or are 40)  they are the only people i feel safe with. Obviously they aren't all sunshine and rainbows the whole time either, like i've said, no one is, but the fact the worst my sister has experienced with them is arguing with each other says a lot. 
That being said, due to the trauma caused by everyone around me, seeing my roommate everyday is hell.

I feel the same type of relief when she isn't there that i felt when my dad wasn't home.
And the same type of panic when she comes home. It's not the ""yay she's back"" that i used to have, it's just a pure disgusted and scared feeling since i've learned that she's just like everyone else i've ever met.

I just yearn for a friend who doesn't use me, who doesn't steal from me, who doesn't touch me on places i don't want it. 

But for now i just need a break, i don't wanna meet up with anyone anymore. I'm scared. 
I know it's gonna be hard from now on to trust people. I was always pretty open and social. But that's honestly over. 

This whole new situation with my roommate has opened up an old wound. It genuinely feels like a re-traumatization. 
I just wanna hurt myself so i can at least calm down a bit. 

Thank you for reading, i appreaciate it.

depression,1ie2nho,Idk what to do,"I have $57 left to my name but the rest are in stocks and i can’t pull them out or I’ll have to talk to Uncle Sam. I’m 28 years old, barely any friends and whenever i want to hang out with them they don’t want to or don’t respond. I guess i need friends. I quit my last job because it’s retail and i hate minimum wage. I’m too anxious to do fuckin anything right, i don’t feel comfortable going to a job every day for the rest of my life until i die. I’m trying to work on my creative passions while I’m unemployed, growing a brand on Instagram. But my life keeps getting in the way. I’m 5’9 and 180lbs i NEVER want to work out. I try to but then i stop again. I only had one girlfriend in my life where everyone else had like 2 or 3 or more. I’m not confident at all… I’m extremely forgetful with aphantasia so a normal job is actually almost impossible for me. I might as well try to call unemployment but they hardly let someone if i have quit my job, but for valid health reasons. I also have IBS as well. My anxiety basically takes control of my life. I’m trapped and don’t know what to do. I only have a high school degree. If i do get educated, would i even be able to get a job? Since I’ve read college is hard to actually find a career where you’re happy at. Since i don’t have a car, everything is so out of reach right now it’s pretty sad. I’m just trying to make money with stock but every move i make will be taxed, and i don’t have any income to begin with so why tax the unemployed? America is a scam, especially if you’re poor or have no direction in life. My stupid learning disability keeps me from progressing further. I also don’t have medical coverage anymore and I’m really scared of my future. The only good thing is i get plenty of rest, my mom lets me stay at her place until i figure things out, and i can work on my creative side. So far at least my instagram is growing but it’ll take a long time to figure out how to sell my digital art to the masses. I’m open for anything if anyone would point me in the right direction? I feel like i can’t do anything right because of my extreme forgetfulness, and people always make fun of the unemployed. Well, there’s reasons why we have these issues. It’s not us wanting to be lazy. Right now I’m just in a fight for survival mode.

depression,1ie213b,teacher attachment,"growing up, I had always been attached with my teachers but recently I've found myself particularly attached to one. Im a grade 10 student and the teacher happens to be my Spanish teacher. He's a man in his mid thirties and he's really nice. He's always noticed that something had been off and that I wasn't chatty like all the other kids- I usually sat in his class and zoned out. One day I was drawing on the back of my page and my sleeves had hiked up a bit and I hadn't noticed.(I've struggled with self harm majority of my life.) He approached me and asked me subtly ""what my mom thought about those"" I immediately got up and ran to the bathroom and cried/had a panic attack since me and my mother don't really have the best relationship and she encourages me to self harm but she doesn't think I actually do it. I don't know why but the next day I came to his class and just sat down with him and just told him they were old and that I had stopped (which was a lie.) He didn't believe me and encouraged me to make an appointment with my counsellor which I ended up doing but I will not be talking about my self harm. My mental health has recently been declining since I started high school (September 2024.) I don't really understand why I feel this way because I have friends yet I distance myself every couple of weeks and my friends are understanding. Suicide has been an option on my mind since about grade 6- but I have only once gone through with it but I failed (obviously.) I just don't know why I'm so attached to this teacher. Since the semester is done now I don't have any classes with him but my friend does. I walk my friend to his class just to say about three words to him and it makes me feel happy. He's always letting me know that I can talk to him. Also before anyone says its daddy issues- it's not, I have a great relationship with my father but not my mother.

depression,1ie1utu,I lost all my friends,"For context, I've known my friends for almost 8 years. They live at the other side of the country and we used to meet sometimes. They were important people for me.

I've been depressed for about 2 years. It started after i moved on in my first apartment. I started feeling outside of the friend group. They made promises to come celebrate with me but never did. I started taking medication for my depression and progressively stopped talking to them. They knew I wasn't doing good at all. I found out after that they helped someone of the group to move out.
After 6 months of no contact, the one I was the closest with send me a message to check how I was. I was a bit mad that no one asked before or that they did stuff together without me so I told them. I got a response saying how I was wrong and I didn't respond. After a while, I found out that they met at an event where we used to meet and it made me really sad to see it. I sent them a message saying I was wrong in my message and saying that it was because I was depressed. And they welcomed me back in the group.

After that and for a few months, I had really small chats with them. At first it was very nice cause I felt seen again, they asked me how life was etc. But it progressively got bad. I tried to follow what was going in their life but I felt like they were not doing that for me. I was always outside of the discussions and stuff.
The last event was me sending a message in the group chat. I was suggesting an activity where I live, a concert. I was expecting a negative response cause I knew it was the kind of music they didn't really like. But I was like ""we never know"". But I never got a response and it hurt.

I had a few talks with my therapist about it. She asked what was the last positive thing they brought me and I didn't have an answer. I realised I didn't belong in the group and decided to leave. I wanted to write a message before leaving the group. But all I could write felt aggressive so I decided to not send anything.

I know I have efforts to make to open to people. I did some with them but it didn't have positive responses anymore. And my therapist told me that it was better to evolve in a space where my efforts were reciprocated.

I left a few days ago and deleted them on the same social media. Today, I got a message from on of them. It was a screenshot of one of them was writing a message to me. The message basically says that the one I was the closest with is just wondering what he could have done better, and that I was really ungrateful.

I felt like it was the best decision but now I feel like a horrible person. I'm also terrified to be alone for the rest of my life, because if the people I've been the closest with in my entire life can feel that about me, it feels completely lost in advance ",1,2025-01-31 01:16:08,0,1.0,Diaphrem

depression,1idwicb,I dont know how to move on.,"Hey all, I neeed some help.  I (46M) am having major depression and having trouble even seeing the good in much.  I am not sure how to begin.

I was in what was probably the best relationship of my life that started back in 2022.  I was introduced to the most wonderful woman, and we hit it off really well and started a serious relationship soon after.  This was all during some random health issues that were taking a mild toll, but I was dealing well.  about 8 months later I had a very bad case of covid, and it was probably the sickest I had ever been in my life.  It gave me more health issues, and I became depressed.  I took some time off work and started on an SSRI, and it seemed to help.  A few months later I was beginning to be indifferent on life in general, and was becoming more irritated at small things, and my gf in general.  She was trying so hard this entire time to help, but I kept slipping away.  Then in November of 2023 I did the dumbest fucking thing of my life and broke it off.  I knew I loved her, I just didnt feel anything.  At all.  I was just emotionless.  It basically destroyed her as she didnt see it coming.  But she continued to try to help, and I kept slipping away and eventually broke off contact.  I realized around May that the SSRI was giving me major issues, so I went off of it.  I had a month of the brain zaps, and then two weeks of the worst anger I have ever had, and nothing triggered it.  I finally leveled out Mid July of last year, and I knew that I had messed up, but I thought that I had done enough damage that I should leave her alone.  I spoke with a mutual friend of ours, and she encouraged me to reach out to my ex, which I did.  

  
To keep it shortish, we have been in limited contact since around October, but she did start dating someone else in the July-August time frame.  We both said that we wanted to keep in contact, and had a decent 1 hour phone call in December.  Our friend thinks there are issues and it wont last, but I talked with my Ex last Friday, and she was excited that she bought a house.  I was/ am really happy for her, but on Saturday it hit me that her new BF is moving in with her at the house.  Our friend thinks the same.  So it hit me that this wont be working out like I wanted it to.  Saturday and Sunday I was ok, with some lost sleep, and Monday I was off work.  Tuesday morning it hit me hard about 2 am, and Ive been sobbing off and on since then.  I know what I lost and that it was my fault.  I am going to break off contact and give her some space, and I told my friend to let her know if I come up in conversation.  I have fought with depression off and on for 20 years, and this time I just dont know what to do.  I've been trying my normal routine on dealing with depression (breathing exercises, therapy, reaching out to friends, getting out of the house, clear out all reminders of her, etc), but this one came on hard and fast, and none of it is working.  I have a dr appt to possible get onto a different antidepressant than what I was on before.  I keep having panic attacks, and again the sobbing.  After therapy yesterday I felt a bit better, but today fell apart on me.  I've been off work all week.  

  
So, any advice for someone that is in it deep right now?  I just dont know what to do.  ",2,2025-01-30 21:22:55,0,1.0,turbo9301

I wanted to reach out anywhere so many times in my worst even type a reddit post but thought of the work and pain  it requires is a great dostractor to just lose yourself in pain you already feel so I just choose to wait out the worst moment and still don’t reach out.

depression,1idw62b,I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life.,"Hi everyone. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD, bipolar disorder & bpd. Was on meds but I flushed them while on a manic episode—probably going to go to the hospital at some point to get better cause I’m starting to feel terrible.

Anyway, not many people talk about the frustration about you not knowing what to do in the future and it’s sad. I’m not overly joyous about anything. Yes I like to do some stuff, but I just can’t see myself doing that as a career. I *want* to be employed and do something but idk what. I graduated HS and was in college but got suspended due to mental health reasons.

I thought about the **military**; frankly I don’t like the world and I’m also transgender…and what’s going on now with the bans would be too much. I like **baking**; I’d have to go to culinary school which costs money. I like **animals**; but I’m not good at math or science—which I need to properly take care of one as a vet. Right now being an **EMT** seems a bit interesting but I know I don’t have enough empathy for others (nor the patience) to deal with people constantly.

I just don’t know and I hate it so much. Everyone around me is either in college or the military, even my younger friends have jobs and I’m just here like🧍🏾‍♂️I feel so useless.

depression,1ie0xg3,my best friend’s depressed and refuses talking to me. Need advices !,"For about 4 years now, she sometimes sends me texts like « I really wanna die » or some things like so, back then, we were 14 and I had no idea how to react. It’s been a year since it didn’t happen, so I thought it was going better. 

When we were 13 she was always in a good mood and it’s just been getting worst. Her mood just snapped in a week or two. She stopped smiling much, laughing less and canceling plans we had. It kept on going for 3 years, until we were 17. Before, I helped her my best, not really knowing what to do. It started going better. We would hang out more, she didn’t tell me about her family’ problems and her death « threats » anymore. 

I was happy with it, but recently, she snapped in front of me after I saw her fresh self harm scars on her thighs. I accidentally walked in when she was changing up. She cried and explained to me thzt it hadn’t been too well. I didn’t tell her about my own old problems because idk. I think it might prove her I can understand, but at the same time I don’t really know what’s going on. 

When I was 14-17 I struggled with depression myself, including self-harm, tobacco addiction… I never ever told anyone, and hid all signs.

Now I need advices. Should I tell her about my own old problems or would it sound selfish ? She refused to share more with me and didn’t even stay to sleep the night I found out. She doesn’t let me in when I come to her house… I’m scared for her. ",0,2025-01-31 00:32:39,1,0.5,user-174

I struggled to socialize and make friends during primary and I still do:( It's okay to be the ""odd one out"", because ""normal"" doesn't exist. Nobody is ""normal"". We are all unique in our own ways and YOU MATTER. You are validated. Even I can't validate myself but YOU ARE VALID. I know you can do it! Hang in there!! Don't give upppp:(( Giving up isn't the problem solver. We need to keep trying. But before you say, ""but I tried"" or ""I am trying and I can't anymore"", listen, I know you've tried but try harder and try more. I'm sorry if thisnis too harsh but we need to keep pushing ourselves and keep trying. We won't get better if we don't TRY. Actual trying, like practice box-breathing, eat sour candies, talk to someone, do art, SEEK HELP, or maybe just make someone happy so that you will be happy:) I will be with you in your recovery!

depression,1ie0p9o,What is your best and non-harmful coping strategy?,"Mine is not thinking too much of xyz which are bothering me. I learned it after years of exhausting overthinking coupled with suffocating anxiety.

Also when in immigration I had to make living for myself because I was alone in the country, I was doing things which were difficult for me both socially and psychologically. 

One example- I had one housemate at one point and she never was seen outside her room as there was a toilet and shower in it. Her boyfriend told me that she has social anxiety and she is gutted when she has to come out.
And I thought to myself wow that’s where I should be at but instead of it I am a delivery person with lots of socialising. Because I don’t have a boyfriend paying for my room, food etc.. Then I was recreation assistant and again with large people flow. I hated my days on the job but I was still doing it because I needed money.

Another example- oh how I hated school- I was too sensitive and even getting headaches from the noise levels during breaks. But homeschooling wasn’t and option, I haven’t thought about such option until covid lockdowns.

One more example- I have suffocating sensation from my anxiety. But I applied for the job during Covid and I worked in a mask, which also made my glasses foggy. As much as it was bothering me I kept working there because that was the plan. I would stop in my ways and grab the bread shelves I was loading, people walking around me, and I was gasping for air trying to make an inhale, sometimes for the duration of couple of minutes, and no one cared. So didn’t I. But those were low-key panic attacks.

So it was horrible to live through such daunting conditions for me, I developed burnout and went into major depressive episode after few years like so, but now I know I am capable to adapt and live however will be required…


And when something is bothering me, I pretent to myself that I sort of don’t have this problem.
I treat my struggles as a game and brush them off. Not escaping though- I acknowledge that I have it and kind of playfully challenge myself, asking, so what?

depression,1idzulh,How to deal with having to end a relationship with someone who you get along with almost everything.,"Ok so I (29f) ended my relationship yesterday with my now ex (32m) yesterday. So some backstory a few days ago I had a severe mental breakdown triggered by my Zoloft interacting with painkillers prescribed after my tonsectomy. Now I’ve had 2 or 3 other breakdowns in the in the past not caused by pain killers but were still extremely bad and debilitating. I called him during this one and I realized that he really wasn’t able to provide the support I needed to get me through hard times. He has mental health problems as well but it’s more like he struggles with empathy but not in a narcissistic way. It’s more like he can’t really put himself in my shoes with depression and anxiety cuz of childhood trauma he has. Like he was very worried about me but he would say things like maybe you have a fever and it’s making you worry, or maybe you just need sleep, and maybe you’re coming down with something. When I really just needed someone to talk me down and try to imagine how I’m feeling. He even apologized that he didn’t know what to say and was at a loss of what to say or how to help. He really is sweet and always did things to make me happy but when I was at a low mentality he just couldn’t help and it would make me feel worse. So after a few days and after seeing a doctor  I calmed down I started to think “What will I do if parents are gone and I have a mental break and all I have is him?” I thought about this for a a few days, thought hard. And I came to the conclusion that I had to end the relationship cuz even tho we are compatible is almost everything else that one thing is very important to me and I need that support when I’m mentally sick. I told him this and we had a very amicable conversation about it, he told me that he knows he can’t provide what I need in those aspects, and he doesn’t want to make me feel worse in those times. He told me that he just wants me to do what is best for me even though he doesn’t want to break up and does really care about me. We both agreed that we both care allot about each other and will miss our relationship because otherwise it was pretty great. But he agreed that I need that missing link. It was a bittersweet break up and even at the end he was trying to make me laugh cuz he hates when I cry.

depression,1idzjkn,An Ode To The Downtrodden,"As of typing this, things are not well. In fact, things have never been ""well"", so to speak. The life I've lived, whilst I won't claim to having been the worst and that I am above all, has had its serious downsides. There are many small intricacies and complex webs that make up this endless, vicious cycle of sadness, anger, and despair. Family, relationships, my identity; the list can go on infinitely.

I'm not typing this post to share my woes however. I could; it'd probably be therapeutic. Instead, I'd like to use my frustrations to make a different kind of post; one that perhaps will be buried beneath everyone's unheard cries for help, yet if it reaches at least one individual, then that is enough satisfaction for me.

Let's not beat around the bush too much; for many, we've been dealt a bad hand. Some of us have had perhaps the death of a loved one break them into pieces. Some others perhaps have been in an abusive relationship. And of course, some of us perhaps were even hurt specifically because we reached out to others who turned their back on you because of ""X"", ""Y"" or ""Z"" reason. There are too many reasons as to why many of us are in this current state of destructive self-loathing. It's not fun, and to have others tell you that you should appreciate what you already have, or that others have it worse than you; it goes without saying that this does nothing but often making you feel even more worse off than you already were.

So that's been established; things are not good. What am I going to do? Am I going to offer some miraculous answer to solve everyone's problems? Am I going to regurgitate the same old ""Things will get better"" we all get told day-to-day?

Au contraire. I don't have an answer. Nor do I have a solution. And you'll find me six feet under before I tell you something which I can't say with certainty, even if the possibility is always there.

Instead, using the frustrations that are within my being because of the many difficulties I've been facing since youth, I want to share with you this: whatever situation you're facing, whatever hurdle you're dealing with - you are doing your best. 

How does this help you? It honestly might not at all. And that's fine. You've been conditioned to think that the world is out to get you; perhaps it actually is. Yet despite that, even if I cannot offer you anything of actual substance, there is one thing I can tell you which only you can decide for yourself if it's true or not; that being that you're trying your best. 

You may not think you're doing your best. Others might tell you you're not doing your best. You can be sitting on some old couch eating your sorrows away while just mindlessly doom-scrolling here on Reddit. No matter what it is your doing or where you are right now, you need to know that you are doing your best.

Could you do more? Absolutely. But that's for a more stable, more refined you to sort out. Right now, where you are, the fact that you are still living and breathing (even if you have attempted to end it all before) demonstrates you are trying your best. It may mean nothing to you; but to I, the writer of this post, it means everything. Because the fact that you're taking the time to read this post and listen to me ramble about something which you likely will disregard and go back into your vices tells me that you at least had, or have, some willingness to listen to what I have to say. And I want to say to you: you are trying your best. You are doing your best. No matter what is currently happening in your life, you are making do with what you have; therefore recognise the warrior inside of you, no matter how bloodied and exhausted they are, which has kept you still here with us.

I don't need clicks. I don't need likes. I don't need anything that Reddit provides me. This post could have one view until the end of time. But that one view, that one person who maybe took the time to read this stranger's post on the internet, I will repeat it over and over for you until it is burned into your brain: you are trying your best. You are working with what you have and making the most of it. And regardless of what you choose to do with that information, be it disregard it, say it is worth nothing; know that there is one person who recognises the effort you're putting in. Whether it be you just spending your days doom-scrolling or having a work-out routine; you are doing your best.

Im 23 and recently Ive been incredibly depressed. Lost my job and had to move back in with my parents. Im also in debt and have no money. My bank account is zero. My parents give me food and shelter so i dont die. I have been jobless for two months now. 

Understandably this lead to a depression which spiraled out of control until i am completely convinced that my life is not worth living anymore. It is like i believe this as much as i believe the sky is blue. 

I started smoking weed with some friends. And it is almost like a switch is flipped when im high. Its not like a gradual shift. Instantly i am come to the thought that maybe im over reacting to this situation and that there is a way out. If you do think about it objectively my situation is bad but its nothing i cant fix. 

I only feel like myself when im high. Its like when im sober im possessed or something. I guess this is what you call ""drug dependency"" but really, honestly it doesn't feel harmful. 

I know weed can keep people stuck in life for a long time as i learned from my own experience.   But at this point in my life the good far outweighs the bad. ",58,2025-01-30 01:27:41,9,0.95,Prudent_Definition30

depression,1idqamn,I will never be on the same level of importance for my friends as they are to me because they already have a family,"My parents sure try their best, is just that their best is the emotional maturity of a 14 year old boy who is unable to see past his own nose.
Two psicologist have suggested or hinted that they both might be narcissistic, and that seems wild to me. (From audios I took of us fighting and chat conversations, not from only my perspective)

I have always looked out for a family in my friends, but all of them have loving families. The two of them whose parents are as ""uncaring"" as mine have siblings that support them through anything.
I just don't think they know what it is to be alone.
I can't force them to love me as family, so I try to reduce my emotionally dependency of them, but it just makes me feel even more lonely because for tiny moments I feel like I belong with them. 

Even with my partner, whose whole family know about my family way of doing things, it is kind of weird. I totally understand his point. His family is very wellcoming, honestly the most healthily structured family I've ever interacted with. I am still surprised over how much love his mom constantly gives him, and how his sister and niece are so caring towards him. More than one time I've been confused over his mothers actions just for him to explain to me that that's just the normal way of treating your children.

They are like that for everyone, they have invited me to their family vacation, to the younger ones catholic communion... but I think he pushes back on it. His older niece called me aunt as a joke (not in front of the little ones, obviously) and my partner cut it out completely at the moment it happened. His niece is super kind, she talks a lot. 
Since he knows my story with my family and how lonely I feel, I'm terrified that he might think that I want to insert myself onto his. I would never do that. I would rather keep on being lonely forever than to be the slightest annoyance.

One time that he was working and I was playing cards with his family, his sister even told me that I have got a family in them and I started bawling instantly. It's not true though. I don't have family. If anything went wrong, a fight or whatever between my partner and myself, even if I was right in that specific moment... blood is thicker than water.

I'm tired of being alone. I wish I had a sibling, I wish my parents were better.
I'm sure they love me as a daughter, but I also know they dislike me as a person. (Not an exaggeration).

I don't know if I can live with this pressure in my chest forever. I can't blame anyone for it I just have to live with it, and I can't. Everyday is a struggle. I wake up already tense from sharing space with my parents and the knowledge that I am not the child they wanted. I have to see my close ones have beautiful relationships with their families and swallow my envy and just be happy for them.

I can't ask for better and this isn't enough. I can't take a whole life of this. ",3,2025-01-30 17:04:37,0,1.0,Maybe_Artemis
depression,1ido7px,Screaming out my pain silently,"She stood on the edge of the cliff… This is how I wanted to start the short story. But it’s just so overused and cliché. Who am I to share anything with the world? Who would want to listen to me…

This is the voice I hear in my head. Some days, it gets louder and drowns out any rational thoughts, and that is when I feel like the whole world is collapsing on me—like when you shut yourself in a room without windows and blink your eyes just to make sure they aren’t closed, only to realize that the total darkness is real.

This is when you feel the world swallowing you, the tears streaming down your cheeks, your throat closing up, unable to breathe in or out. This is the moment you feel like you exist in that vast nowhere and your name is nothing. This is when the pain is so crippling that the only thing you can do is hunch down on the floor, holding onto your knees just to make sure that some physical part of you is still there.

This is when time stops.

You wonder if this is the time paradox that Einstein was talking about… That your time spiraled down with so many bumps, bruises, and scrapes, dragging you along the way to the deepest, darkest pit, speeding up and getting so out of your control that finally, it stops. And you are alone—the no one in the empty nothing, feeling only pain on the inside.

Pain so unbearable that you would scream it all out, but your body is not yours anymore. It refuses to move. So you sit there on the cold bathroom floor (*my dark room is the bathroom*), feeling the cold tiles and breathing in the darkness between the silent sobs. Silent—because you are sure that everyone is exhausted by you feeling this way for such a long time.

But then the tears stop.

Your breath returns to normal—*in and out, in and out.* Your heart stops pounding in your head, and you just sit there, your body against the cold tiles. Your eyes are open, but it is so dark that you cannot make out any shapes, and you wonder if this is what blindness feels like.

You don’t know how you got here, what is so wrong with you—because it always has to be you, not the world. Only you. You are sure that there is something horribly, terribly wrong with you, and you search every corner of your mind to find that exact moment when everything went wrong in your life.

She stood on the edge of the cliff and saw the boat in the distance. It had white sails, and she and her loved one would be united soon. He did come back to her, and there was no trickery, no betrayal, no red sails. She stood there and looked at the empty sea for so many days, weeks, and years. And then, she saw hope.

This is how I want the story to go. This is how it should go.

Tragedies are beautiful when they are written on paper—not when they become your life.

So look at the darkness. Look at it until you start discerning that little, thin line under the door. There is light there. It means that you still exist, and that you need to go on, no matter how difficult it is.

Look for the light.

This is when, maybe, you can convince yourself of the truth—and you will gain a small victory if you believe it, even for just a short second.

That truth is this: *you exist, and you are perfect just the way you are, simply because you exist.* The thing you were looking for does not exist—there is no unforgivable flaw in you. You have done nothing wrong.

You are in the darkness, and you need to find the light. And even if your body refuses to move, you can still reach for the light by believing this truth.

Every time you remind yourself to believe in it, even just a little bit more, it brings you closer to the light—away from the darkness.

You do not need to get up and open the door right away.

Just look for the light.

That is the first step.",4,2025-01-30 15:30:36,3,1.0,cinnamon-kot
depression,1idyl78,Trying lamotrigine before Zoloft/lexapro?,"Currently on vyvanse/adderall generics along with Wellbutrin 150 for add/depression (also as needed propranolol for anxiety). Tried a higher Wellbutrin but not a noticeable difference so back to 150. Depression’s definitely more present and things are just very blah these days so I recently tried out vilazodone but it didn’t help and already weaned off. 

My doc recommended lamotrigine due to generally less side effects such as weight gain in comparison to ssris (outside of the potential rash) and since vilazodone didn’t work for me.

Looking for any thoughts on trying this out first before Zoloft or lexapro? Given that those are so commonly prescribed and I hadn’t even heard of this one before, wondering if I should at least try those first. Overthinking all the possible side effects of each, and all the mention of this rash has me wondering. 

Yes Ill talk to my doc next week (I picked up my first dose but haven’t started yet so may just wait) And I know everyone’s different, but just curious from those who’ve tried this before or after Zoloft/lexapro what your experiences were in comparison.

My girlfriend broke up with me 30 days ago after I got in a car accident and I haven’t heard from her since. I think she started dating a guy I work with at a large company.

I have no friends because I have trust issues. You usually make friends with coworkers, I don’t believe in doing that because they usually use you/abuse you in some way to get ahead. It’s very slimy/back stabbing at the level I am at in my company. However it’s a very good job and I am paid extremely well. I don’t want to leave town because of that and because my family are near by.

I don’t have a drinking problem in the sense that I have to be drinking all of the time; but when I do drink I binge and bad things happen shortly after I open up and become the life of the party. So I steer clear for the most part. My town is either college kids or middle aged married couples with kids, there are very few single 30 year olds I have found. 

All of my friends have gotten with someone serious and/or moved away. So I’m kind of the only one left in my original friend group. I am not a bad looking guy, but I do not meet the requirements of the top 20% to get matches and communication from dating apps.

I thought about doing this on a whim because I have nothing to lose anymore, I’ve been battling chronic depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts/attempts for about four years now, I had a rough childhood, parents weren’t the best, raised in a religious strict environment that always challenged me for being myself and not what people want, I was beat and abused, but I got used to it and the older I got the more rebellious I became, my dad started battling cancer and had a change of heart, now he’s trying to be nice. I appreciate it, but don’t think I should forgive him or my mom. I was a good child and hard working, I got into med school, which I had no interest in, but I live in Iraq and there aren’t many options in terms of career paths. I’m in my third year now and have failed in every subject because I don’t study at all and failing this year seems close. There are many other things that trouble me but I don’t want this to be too long. I want someone to hear me out.
So, I have never felt truly happy in life, and it got worse between the ages of 16-20, now everything I do does not give me any sort of satisfaction, playing video games, playing my guitar, having a girlfriend, traveling, meeting new people, Nothing works.

depression,1idy8fj,Relatives Apathy,"TLDR; Anyone personally experience relatives who choose not to care about you, and how they came to closure/acceptance? 

Studying mental health myself, therapy & research/experience, I have been able to identify the source of my depression: Loneliness & Feeling Unloved. 

A major source of that was my mother (a long story, abusive & alcoholic, regretted having kids, lived in my car etc), but today at 25, I realized that it spreads to my siblings. Especially my 10 years elder sister, who just had a baby. 

Due to the trauma I have diagnosed anxiety, depression, C-PTSD, & Bipolar. I have been suicidal my whole life. Recently lost job unfairly, lost car and had a bipolar mania episode where I wanted to die. Important: Mental Illness runs directly in my family on one side (our mother, her 3 brothers, my grandpa, etc). My uncle is in his 50’s, has schizophrenia and gets monthly shots, but has never taken them consistently, for 30 years. My sister is 35. She recently expressed the stress, and effort she put into finding his whereabouts today. The counsellor and empathic side of me completely understands and agrees with her that dealing with someone with mental illness is exhausting in many ways (ding ding I’m here as an example lol). But the SISTER, and human side of me felt a SLAP IN THE FACE. She’s never cared that much, or put that much effort into me, even with everything. It fucking hit me. I was enabling this person, who wouldn’t do the same for me I would for her, make me sad and grieve. 

I always felt sad and was almost begging my sister to choose me. She never did. So I would be sad, and cried, and wonder why I’m so horrible that she didn’t want me. We were even abused together! Yet she didn’t want me. It’s isolating. 

Then today something clicked: I only cared because I thought it wasn’t true, and was needing her to show me or tell me I’m wrong. But after a group chat convo with other cousins, it became evidently clear that I was right. I stopped in my tracks on my phone, tears immediately stopped. I was immediately numb. I was right. If I was right, then THIS IS reality, and not my depression. I have a sister who chose, in her adult life, to not have me in it. She chose, as an adult, to not use her energy and empathy towards me. She chose to give it to others instead. You see other people who chose not to be friends with their siblings and go ‘I understand, your feelings are valid”. 

But what if it’s not justified? Of course life is dynamic and maybe I hurt her in ways I will never know unless I ask her. And I should one day (if I’m still here). AND, there is still a possibility that I don’t deserve to be isolated. There is a possibility that she is unfairly & purposefully ignoring my calls for love. Maybe it is her protecting her peace. Maybe I am a source of pain for her, or maybe it’s just easier to not care about me when I need help. 

TL:DR; Has anyone came out the other end, and have a story of accepting a sibling who chooses to not care about them/have them in their life/show them the same empathy as others. ",1,2025-01-30 22:35:50,0,1.0,SquishyGuinny

Anyway, not many people talk about the frustration about you not knowing what to do in the future and it’s sad. I’m not overly joyous about anything. Yes I like to do some stuff, but I just can’t see myself doing that as a career. I *want* to be employed and do something but idk what. I graduated HS and was in college but got suspended due to mental health reasons.

I thought about the **military**; frankly I don’t like the world and I’m also transgender…and what’s going on now with the bans would be too much. I like **baking**; I’d have to go to culinary school which costs money. I like **animals**; but I’m not good at math or science—which I need to properly take care of one as a vet. Right now being an **EMT** seems a bit interesting but I know I don’t have enough empathy for others (nor the patience) to deal with people constantly.

I don’t want to die or anything like that I just feel like life was wasted when I was born. I am currently 31 years old living on disability never felt like I had any talent for anything good for nothing really other then taking up space. Family just deals with me because I am family I guess. I feel like I never really pick up on social cues. On my 31 years on this earth I feel like I maybe had 1-2 actual friendships with people outside of my family. Again I don’t want to die but I feel like I am just taking up space. Never really told anyone I feel this way before due to fears that they would think I was suicidal which I am not. Will this feeling ever go away ? I don’t know if it will but I guess I will just continue to be what I am pretty much nothing I guess.,13,2025-01-30 08:05:51,1,0.94,AnimeFan_700

depression,1idr3eo,"So I took an antipsychotic that’s also an antidepressant for about 4 weeks and it was working well, tried it a second time later on and it’s not working yet, do I need to wait?","I was prescribed every typical drug for depression after trying every antidepressant over a decade and nothing was working. 

We finally found a medication that worked, and it worked extremely well after 2-3 weeks of taking it. It’s called 1.5mg Vraylar which is considered an antipsychotic but at low doses it also has some strong antidepressant properties…. and is even prescribed as add on treatment for depression when the antidepressants aren’t fully effective. 

I felt happier than I did in over 10 years, and I was accomplishing different things I needed to do in my life and when I did them I felt massively rewarded and almost happy for the first time in my life in over a decade. 

I continue to do those things and keep accomplishing things but the Vraylar was increased to 3 milligrams for a month or two and the antidepressant effect completely quit working so my doctor recommended I switched back to 1.5mg Vraylar since I had the best results with the lowest dose and according to Vraylar’s studies 1.5mg was the most effective dose for treating depression. 

It’s been around 2 weeks of taking the 1.5mg Vraylar and I’m noticing MORE depression, not less. 

I’m praying to God and hoping by week 3 everything will change around the antidepressant effect will come back because I really need it right now and for a while until I can get my life together. ",2,2025-01-30 17:38:33,2,1.0,kalivoidd

depression,1idtuhc,My partner of 7 years broke up with me over text message and never returned home.,"Hi all. Just sending this out into the world hoping for some kind words. This week my partner went out of town to visit a friend and I received a long text on the day he was supposed to return. He told me he would not be coming home and that we would be flying to live with his sister in Virginia and then moving to Portugal shortly thereafter. 
My partner has very severe ptsd and ocd and went on a trip with his sister a few months ago and suddenly decided he needed to move there because it is so much safer than the US. We had many conversations where we spoke about possibly just moving to a safer city in the US (we live in one of the most dangerous) and I even said I was open to moving to Portugal I just wanted it to be a decision we made together as a couple and not one out of fear. 
My partner’s ptsd is so severe he at times has exhibited agoraphobia and experiences chronic night terrors. He is on edge at all times no matter where we are. I do not believe even moving to another country will solve these deeply rooted childhood traumas he possesses. 
Before he left to go out of town we had a fight about moving to Portugal, I asked if I did not want to go would he leave me or find another way for us to be okay here in another state. He told me in no uncertain terms he would go to Portugal but that we could “make it work still.” I began to hyperventilate and sob and I am autistic so I smacked myself in the face at one point which is nothing unusual it is common in autistics to do this to regulate. He later told my my mother (who asked him what in the world is going on after I received a breakup text and was blocked) that he was in fear for his life because of my actions and that he slept with his hand over his heart in fear that I would stab him in his sleep. I have never in all our years expressed any aggression towards him whatsoever nor have a made any threats to his wellbeing. I have only ever been supportive and tried to help him manage his irrational fears. I feel so ashamed of my autism and my meltdown and fear it has cost me my relationship. Or maybe that is just the excuse he is using so that he can justify leaving the country and choosing fear over a life with a family who loves him. I do not know. 

He told me a loved me and that he always would and then proceeded to block me and abandon me to pick up the pieces and left his belongings behind. I am now having to move back in with my mother since I can no longer afford to live fully alone on my salary and I am also honestly afraid to be alone with how devastated and heartbroken I am. 
This is someone I loved with all my heart and we had been planning to be married in the  very near future.

depression,1idiixk,"I've just prevented my girlfriend from killing herself, please help me help her","I don't even know where to start and I feel like I'm running out of time. She's sleeping right now next to me, after I managed to convince her to take her dose of quetiapin (50mg) + an extra (25mg). Her psychiatrist said that if she had an anxiety attack she could take the extra one, but I'm not even sure this was an anxiety attack, we've never experienced something like this. 

I think everything started when she told me that she was only going to the psychiatrist for me. We were talking before about everything and she told me again that she's never stopped thinking about suicide and death this whole time (she only went to the psychiatrist twice, he prescribed quetiapin + fluoxetin and also going to the psychologist, but she's been postponing it for two weeks and I didn't want to pressure her). She also says that I'm too good for her, that she doesn't deserve me, that she's bad, causes harm to other people, that everything would be better without her, etc. 

I've tried to explain to her that sometimes I'll feel bad because her pain is painful to me as well and, even though I try to be optimistic, sometimes I can't simply control myself and I'll cry. I don't want this to cause even more harm to her, which is why I talked about it beforehand. I swear I've smiled in some of the worst scenarios but it's still painful knowing that my tears will make her think ""he's better without me"". 

I think it was this which sparked this ""episode"", I don't even know how to call it. I froze for a moment in front of her, with my hands covering my face. After a minute I noticed that she walked out of the room and I instinctively went after her. I noticed something weird in her face and body: I asked how was she and she told she was going to the kitchen. I asked what she needed and that she could wait for me in our room, but she asked to be alone. At this point I already knew she was thinking about grabbing a knife from the kitchen, but I was blocking the entrance to the kitchen the whole time while talking to her. She grew more anxious by the minute and she couldn't hide it anymore, so she tried to outrun me but I grabbed and hugged her. We were there for a while but then she went to my room, were I had a cutter that she could grab. Every time I was blocking something I could she her eyes scanning the room looking for sharp objects. We were at this for what seemed like 2-3 hours, I'm not even sure. 

She didn't show any of the panic or anxiety attack symptoms. Other times she was frozen or having convulsions, but now she was trying to ""trick me"" while in this state. She would say everything was fine, then say ""I'm thirsty, I just want to grab some water from the kitchen"" and then everything would start again. It was like every inch of her body was looking for ways to kill herself. At some points she also told me that she was suffering, that if I loved her I would let her go, which is honestly very painful to me because I can really see her suffering.

As I said, at some point she was herself again for a moment and took the 2 quetiapin pills, then it started again. Then was herself again and took the 3rd pill. Now she's sleeping: I've hidden every sharp knife in my room with every pill and locked it. I always wake up before her but I'm scared she will wake before me and still feel the same thing. 

I'm not even sure what ""help"" I want. Yesterday I was looking at this sub and what I've noticed is that people who post, like I'm doing, do it to ask for help. She doesn't. She talks of her death as fact, as destiny, and she says that she only went to the psychiatrist for me, so that I don't feel guilty after she dies. She sees her depressed self as ""herself"" and she's been untreated for more than 10 years, I think. It was only after we started dating that she accepted looking for treatment.

Is there any resource online I could look to know what to do? What more can I do besides talking with her psychiatrist in the morning?

P.S. I'm 33, she's 31. We're both from other countries and we're in Mexico studying a very demanding PhD programme. This environment is very hard for her and she also was in this university before the PhD, where she also had some very bad experiences that she's recognised as pushing her to this depression.

I thought incest and fucking animals was NORMAL because of him. I knew sexual terms before I was 8. How does she not get it?

I have no one except my bf. Even then, I have no car, no license, no job, because that cunt will not let me get one. She won't drive me anywhere. She lives off my child support.

I'm so fucking done. I've cut myself and tried jumping out the window, but what is that gonna do? Even if I leave a suicide note saying it's my mom's fault, she's just gonna play victim again and say ""it's all my fault I lost another baby why did I blah blah blah""

So I have no choice right now but to exist with her. Exist with a pedophile fucker.

i've been thinking about this because i'm having some issues and not sure if they're coming from depression or elsewhere. Basically i'm on an SNRI right now, and with it, i have no thoughts of death, can get out of bed each day (i likely have delayed sleep phase syndrome so i go to bed late and wake up late) even if it's in the afternoon usually that i get up, and don't feel extremely down, basically the worst of it is gone, so i thought this meant i was like, doing well, stable or whatever... but i still lack motivation, have sleep issues, appetite fluctuations, fatigue every day, sleep never feels refreshing, life doesn't feel particularly enjoyable because i can't seem to do much.. i'm also unmedicated adhd so i know that certainly doesn't help (stuck in waiting list) but like, could these be residual depressive symptoms? is this normal or does it mean my meds aren't working as they should? i also feel like my mood is stable but not good, i feel ""okay"" like maybe 5/10 most days but i basically never ever feel actually happy.. i know doctors can be super dismissive and say it's ""JUST depression"" as if depression isn't a big deal so i'm trying to work out if this genuinely could be my depression causing all these issues or if it's more likely my adhd or something else..

I hear stories of people regretting their attempts because things got better, but is that actually true?

The only reason I regret my attempts are because I'm still alive and have to go through the consequences of surviving an attempt (scars, stigma, dissapointed friends/family). 

The only reason I haven't tried again is because I'm terrified of surviving and having to go through the aftermath all over again and not actually getting any better.

depression,1idizk8,Coping,"So I (25M) am going through a patch in my life I never really expected to have. Last year if you had asked me about a child I would have laughed as i had never had a relationship let along a desire for a child. No matter what I tried it ended in rejection. But then I met this girl I was just getting to a decent spot having my own home and vehicle. I was doing good on my own learning to be happy bymyself and not desire for a partner like I had. Well as they always have said when I quit it came to me. She was relentless in her pursuit and wouldn't take no for a answer.

I simply didn't believe I could mentally handle a relationship nor what came after if it didn't work out. As much as I wanted it I was correct on not being able to handle it very well.

I was rushed into it a bit too fast and within a few months she was pregnant. Dumb choice from both of us. But I had fallen in love and would do anything for her and that baby. Things were going decent enough she was working on quitting vaping I had put it down. But then she started going to the neighbors quite a bit. I didn't care for that all that much cause she would spend hours of the night there. 

Well I lost my job not long after this started happening and her trips were getting messed up due to this. I feel that agitated things before the money started to even run out.

After a week or so I caught her drinking and smoking a cigarette and that spiraled us into a huge argument. Neighbor didn't know so I couldn't be mad at him until she gave up the fact they were sleeping together behind my back. 

She left and got with him. A few months later now and the little baby bump she had didn't get bigger it went away so that only tells me that my child is no more. I want to seek therapy bit have no means to afford it right now and with how work has been going I'm lucky if I get to eat once every few days let alone afford having someone act like they care.

And it gave my job and place to help my family with my siblings with disabilities as a caregiver under the state. Took the job to help my family but also improve our entire dynamic, considering how abusive and unstable it was throughout my youth. Wanted and hoped that things were going to be different.

Except it wasn't. Made a boundary that I didn't want to lie on their behalf, except I ended up having to to either my father or my mother's behalf with no end. Or rather yet the state in regards to my responsibilities because nobody else wanted to deal with the changes necessary to give my brother and sister a better shot at life. When I finally told the truth, I was called a piece of shit son, and she turned my father against me. We got into it, I broke my hand, now I was in PT for a whole year andy hand isn't the same anymore.

Bedbugs was becoming an issue at my father's home and nobody listened to me about dealing with it and when it just became an issue that wouldn't go away they told me to just deal with it. My GF just left me because of this issue, or rather not bringing it up because I was embarrassed about it. I was dishonest because of my ego and she was right.

I've lost everything because of this family and they never take accountability for it or apologize. Now I'm stuck in a hell that I didn't choose. I just wanted to make things right with my family, only to lose everything because of them. And I only have myself to blame.

I got into quite a nasty relationship last year and I think part of the reason why I allowed myself to get treated a certain way was I just wanted something in life that I could feel connected to and feel wanted in some way.
About a couple of months ago I left her I know I left for a reason however now I'm faced with the consequences of the life I was trying to leave behind as much (as I've tried to avoid it) as well as hating myself for staying in that relationship as long as I did.

But I keep thinking that I must constantly be bothering her with all of this because she doesn’t deserve to have to deal with someone as broken as me. I’m so scared that, by constantly telling her that I’m not okay, I’ll end up overwhelming her with my negative thoughts. And I’m terrified that she’ll abandon me because she has taken such an enormous place in my heart.

I fell into depression when I moved away on my own for my studies. Solitude became a prison I locked myself in, and even today, after returning home to my family, I feel like a part of me never came back from that experience. I constantly want to die when I’m alone with myself because the person I hate the most in this world is me. I hate myself for being an overthinker because there’s not a single moment of rest in my mind where there’s only silence. Instead, I’m stuck with my thoughts, which only focus on my failures and flaws. I feel like I don’t deserve the love people give me, and I have the impression that I’m only good at ruining the good relationships I have. That, unconsciously, I push people away because I’m afraid they’ll see just how broken I am and abandon me because of it.

My sister is truly an amazing person. She’s the only one capable of making me smile, even if that smile is only temporary. And when we each go back to our own homes, I find myself alone and desperate again.

I hate myself for being like this, and I want to die because I can’t take carrying all of this anymore. I’m exhausted from having to live without being able to see a way out. Even though I promised my sister I would live, I struggle so much to find the strength to keep that promise. Even if she never sees this message, I want to tell her that I’m sorry for always bothering her with my problems—because she must have her own too. I’m just selfish, and maybe I do deserve to be abandoned. After all, who would want to be around someone with missing pieces? I wish I could show her, face-to-face, the pain I feel living like this.

I’m so sorry for being depressed, big sister. So sorry for bothering you all the time. I can’t stand myself anymore, and every day, I wake up hoping it will be my last. Because if I were to take my own life, I’d leave people with endless questions about why I made that choice—without the chance to explain, since I wouldn’t be here anymore.

I was diagnosed with ADD because I can sit in a chair without having to move but I loose focus without even noticing. But now I can sit still in class or at home. I'm contadtsntly moving or feeling uncomfortable when I'm not moving and I can't concentrate on anything. ,1,2025-01-30 15:03:37,1,1.0,yourlocalnativeguy
depression,1idnjbk,What can i actually do to fix these? Where do i even start?  Im tired of wasting time doing nothing. Need help,"I just want to do something about it, i just dont know what that ""thing is"" or ""what work"" im supposed to be doing. Which is probably why i fall back to conditioned behaviors because of not knowing what to do or say. I just want to get out of this deep hole, improve for the sake of improvement, and try to make myself and my life better, and i truly dont wanna do all the improvement just to be liked or loved, i want to do it for myself. I dont want to construct a persona thats based on others reactions or construct it to be loved or cared about. 

We all want to feel important and be cared about and feel wanted and loved, with my way its like i try to force it, force connections or friendships, i dont like being so dependent on this, or make it the purpose of my life or revolve my around getting others to like me, i dont want ""making friends or a gf or conversations or being liked my singular goal in my life. 

im in my 20s, i dont want to be like 50 and still struggling with these problems, I want to do something about it right now bc the present is the most important, all those distractions, negative thoughts, toxic shame are basically useless. But idk what i wanna do, and i for sure dont want to go back to the old life style or personality or mindset or behaviors or beliefs systems or conditioned behaviors or addictions. 

I feel like i been taught the wrong lessons, the illogical beliefs, wrong beliefs, and repetitive negative thoughts but i dont want to blame anyone but take responsibility to do something about it. The control is totally in my hands i just dont know what to do about it. 

I think every problem stems from this. 
Basing self worth/happiness/success on others reactions or actions, basically using them as a vehicle for self esteem or using them to fill a void, or boredom, its like i have no genuine interest in them. Even though i would like to meet people since each one is a unique world on their own, but its like my desire for approval validation attention and to prove myself is way more than being interested. 

And only ""give to get"" which is just selfish and transactional. 

People pleasing like being a chameleon to be liked or accepted, the only thing i have known my entire life is people pleasing and chasing others and being dependent on their approval validation attention like an approval junkie, so i have no idea what i want or who i am truly, i havent put in the work or effort to figure out who i am or who i want to be, so im like a puppet and my decisions are based on others approval validation attention reactions, all aimed towards ""being loved, liked, cared about, chased"" and if those dont happen i feel worthless, not good enough not funny enough not intelligent enough. All of this to protect my ego, anything less than perfection is a failure

And everything is like a cover, a coping mechanism to avoid disapproval, and its out of the goodness of my heart, its selish, i do it in order to be considered ""good enough lovable interesting important""

chasing approval validation attention just to feel like im ""good enough""

Seeing others as a ""goal"" to achieve so i feel good enough, or to boost my confidence or ego, or feel ""good enough"" or be liked cared about be seen as important, and in order to ""achieve"" i become a chameleon because i dont know who i am truly.

I see others reactions as a indicator of my worth, so that's why i sometimes try to control others reactions which puts pressure on me and others, and i get angry at myself for my ""effort, personality, not being good enough or interesting enough"" to make others care.

Giving with strings attached 

Angry at myself for not being able to make a friend or get a gf even though i know even if i had them it wouldnt fix the internel problems, I think they are just another form of procastination or avoidance. 

Seeing a couple or friends talking/having fun activities my insecurities and beliefs about ""not interesting, boring, uncool"" and i immediately think im not good enough to have those, a few years in college with no friends that are two sided, and never a girl showed any interest in me, I know they dont owe me anything, if i wasn't interested why would they be? But no one has ever shown any care or interest

Which is why i avoid being around people, its like i need constant validation attention approval, even though i dont approve of myself and some of my behaviors like people pleasing, or giving with strings attached, when being around people its like i get ptsd and flashbacks to the times i was ignored or rejected or abandoned so i either try hard to prove that im ""interesting, good enough, intelligent, funny, cool, lovable, worth caring about, important"" or i try hard to avoid it, its like a cycle of insanity, neither approachs help or work or help me create a healthy connection where both contribute. 

It also makes me jealous, angry for not being as social as them and that they both like each other and its two sided interest, and have chemistry and banter together and flirt together it also makes me greedy where i keep wanting more and more, even though deep down i know those wont fulfill me, or fix me or make me happy or make me ""good enough"", its basically attachment to the outcome of every situation or interaction. And that im desperate and needy for a speck of attention approval validation. 

And i think i deflect those insecurities and flaws into others so i feel better about myself

those external factors are just ways to avoid doing the work even though i dont know what that is or where to even start

All those addictions, procrastination, avoidance, is just to keep me in the comfort zone, i want to get into the unknown, the uncertainty i just dont know how.

Every conversation is one sided, i dont know what to talk about or what to say, i see every interaction as a test of my ""self worth, intelligence, personality"" i see everything external like that, its like i have attached my worth to everything external because its ""easier"" than to face my own actions or mistakes or decisions or feelings. 

Using conditioned behaviors because they are all I know or been taught even though they dont work, its like i use these condioned behaviors as coping mechanisms, without them i dont know what i want or who i am, its basically ""unknown"" 

And in any interaction or situation my fight & flight mode becomes activated, i either ""fight"" to prove my worth, or flight to avoid the pain of rejection abandonment loneliness, and many times its ""flight"" because i dont know what to do, and its a new territory, new situation, and the fear of failure is too much

Thinking im only good enough when ""others chase me or talk to me or i make them laugh or love me"" its like conditional love towards myself, and if i dont achieve those im ""not good enough"" 

its like i act like a servant towards others and give even though what i give isnt good enough or genuine because idk how to give to myself so how can i give to others?

And i give just to receive and when i dont receive i feel like i wasn't interesting or cool or funny or good enough. I take it personally, like i wasnt worth caring about or wasnt important enough. 

Its like i have little fuel and i give it to others and expect them to give their all to me. Quite selfish i know

I think i give because fear of loneliness, rejection abandonment, in my mind thats like ""death"" and i do it so i dont become alone forever, because being alone and no one caring means ""worthless"" in my mind. 

Its like i do everything or say everything to avoid disapproval and gain approval, and be loved and liked. 



And forever i have used addictions like porn, tv shows, texting on social medias to numb the pain and the feelings of loneliness but they just make it worse, because i hate not changing, i hate passiveness and feelings of powerlessness but i know i can change, i just dont know what am supposed to do about it all",1,2025-01-30 14:58:19,0,1.0,Pristine_Tell_2450

depression,1idmej5,Please help me understand.,"My boyfriend suffers from depression (and generalized anxiety)  and at the beginning of our relationship he had just gotten off of SSRIs and everything was fine up until a 4-6 weeks ago. He wakes up crying he falls asleep crying and he’s restless when he’s in bed and tells me that he feels claustrophobic and that he’s hot and cold. I want to help him but I just know how. I try rubbing his back and letting him sleep on me but he gets tired of that quick.

When I ask him to tell me how he’s feeling he just shrugs and/or says idk. I know his mind can’t just be blank and it pains me every time I hear him say that. I can’t read him and I want to get a glimpse of what’s going on in his head so bad. I feel so isolated and hurt which I know I shouldn’t be but I feel so stuck.

I’ve recently started lamotrigine for my BPD and I can’t even tell if it’s working (@ 200mg) because I am constantly trying to regulate my boyfriend’s emotions and mine. The last guy I dated also had depression and that pained me so much. 

I love this man so much but I don’t feel like I am being loved in the way that I need. There is no passion, I am constantly being met with apathetic answers and I never know what’s going on in his head. It feels so isolating.

Due to a series of unfortunate events…(to say the least) he is unable to get back on medication right now so I want to know what things I can do to help during this time and what lifestyle changes can he make to help his quality of life.

Some of his habits:
- Drinks soda at least twice a day
- Eats mostly processed foods
- Take a chop (weed & nicotine) from his bong AT LEAST 5 times a day (and that’s when I’m with him)

If anyone suffering from depression or has been in a similar situation what did you do that helped? And do you think there might be other things wrong with him?",1,2025-01-30 14:00:04,0,1.0,swagomoroll

It’s funny to me how when I was 14, I had a small piece of hope that these feelings would get better, would subside, but now I’m 20 and feelings only got worse. 

The social isolation is even worse now.

depression,1iddbgk,I tell my mom about my depression. The worst decision of my life,"So last week I decided to visit my college counselors. I told them that I have a depression and anxiety that's been bothering me this semester. So they then refer me to a psychiatrist in the hospital that their foundation have. Short story I go there, talk to the psychiatrist, take the medicine and go home. 



But then, out of stupidity I guess, I decided to call my mom and tell her about this meeting. At first, the conversation went fine until she begin to ask me a few question.



She: ""Are you commiting a self harm? Like are you cutting yourself with a blade?"" I said no. 

She: ""Are you suffering from hallucinations? Like are you hearing something?"" I said no.

She: 'When is your time to go to bed?"" I said around 12 to 2 Am. 

She: ""Do you suffering from suicidal ideation?"" I said yes.

She: ""But do you ever try to commit suicide?"" I said no.

She: ""does you depression disturb your daily activity."" I said no. I thought that despite its kinda disturb my daily activity i still kinda do my work.



So then she say that I probably just have a sleeping problem because of phone addiction.  

She also says why do gen z really care about such thing as mental health, she thinks that having depression is a trend for gen z. She says that depression can just be heal without a medicine the proof is that my grandma was once like me for months before she decided to stop using anti depressant and just says that it's probably fake, she also says that since I have visited the hospital, that means that my name is registered in the system and I could make it harder for me when applying job. She also upset that I was making decisions for myself instead of talking to themselves first. She said that even if I'm now an adult, I still living with their money and that means that I still technically under their care. If anything happens I should called her first.



Now I have two person inside me fighting. One is angry at her for not taking what I said seriously. One actually is scared that what if she was right, maybe I'm actually fake my depression since I thought that people have a depression and it was just me being a bit weird. 



Worst than that, she then tell my dad about it. He then called me, telling me to not drink my medicine and also says that if I have anxiety, I should just calm down.



Now to be honest, I deeply regretted calling her. I should just shut up, but my blabbermouth can't just shut up about this. If one thing I don't tell her is the reason I don't speak to her first, it because I know that thing will go this way. I know that I tell her this I will only going to get lectured about things that I should and shouldn't do.



Now I don't know what should I do or feel about this. So can you all give me an input or advice about this. Anything is fine. Thank you.

depression,1idavhi,How long till it's okay to end it,"I've been alone all my life.     I'm 25.      Never had a relationship ship never had a partner. Never had a date.   Never even had a kiss.     Im emotionally tired and drained.     I wake up every morning wondering why I even bother anymore.    Maybe I put to much weight into the thought of having a partner to be there and how that would be.      The loneliness is crippling and I just can't do this anymore.  It feels like I'm missing out on life and it's just passing by.     In work, trades, hobbies,  and the like I've always excelled.      Relationships.   I dont know if I can even say I've failed because I've never had one to fail.       I only ever once talked to one girl like the possibility of dating. And it was now 7 years ago.    I the end she wasn't even interested.    She just used me to get to a (now) former friend of the past.           

All I've wished for for years is a girl to be there by my ide and somone to go through life with.      I want to know what it's like to have somone there who wants to be there and truly cares.    I want to know what it's like to just go through life and not feel like I'm standing still.      And now at this point I know the odds of having a relationship with somone who has also never been in one is just about none.      So going through and even just learning how a relationship works.   Well I'm on my own.    


I just can't take being alone anymore and I just want to end it at this point.   I want somone to talk to.    Somone to hug and someone  to have some form of intimacy with.     And I just don't think it was ever in the cards for this life.

Almost the entirety of my life I have struggled with depression. I had thought in the past of ending my time on earth but was always too afraid to go through with it. I survived longer than I had thought was ever possible. I made it past childhood but found adulthood to be even harder in some aspects. I found myself regretting not ending my life as a child since people can forgive a child more easily for that action. Then when I was in a car accident, I was happy to live for a brief moment but then I just thought about how I should have just died in the accident. It is hard at times because I wish I wasn't even born. What is the point of life if life is so miserable? This world is so messed up with uncaring people. It gets harder day by day.

depression,1idjb5p,I feel so alone,"I M(23) am currently in one of the worst places mentally that I have ever been in. For context I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life and for the last couple years I have been better but as of recently I have started to deteriorate again.

I have been in a relationship for 3 years with a F(23).
I started to get down, sad, anxious, depressed and during that time she didn’t seem to care, to try and help me, instead telling me that she doesn’t feel loved because I didn’t spend enough time with her. I would soon leave her as I supported her though everything she had been though but as soon as I was in need of that support, I didn’t have it, instead getting upset that I couldn’t be there for her during my time of need.

I tried to get back in contact with my friends which has not worked.
After the break up, I ended up getting back in contact with my ex who I am currently going hiking with as she seems to be the only one who wants to hang around with me(just as friends).

I have support from my family and the few people who are in my life but I feel still feel completely and totally alone. Wanting to go back to my old ways of drinking to solve my problems, wanting to hurt myself or worse.

But I am trying to hold on to the small amount of hope I have left, as I am trying to get help, I’m seeing a therapist and I am on anti depressants but that glimmer of hope is fading away day by day, I cry everyday, I am in complete misery everyday. I am alone everyday. I’m not a very social person so making friends isn’t easy for me and the way I am now, it is very difficult to try.

The only upside to any of this is that work said that no matter what, no matter how much time I have off, that they will be there for me when I get better. 

I feel I’ve let my family down and I feel I’ve let myself down. I feel unloved and unworthy of it, I feel like an empty shell, hollow, lonely.

Even though I’m getting help from my doctor and therapist, I still feel that nothing is going to change, I sometimes fear for my own safety ",1,2025-01-30 10:29:48,3,1.0,DrMontyMoo
depression,1id6597,I hate myself for getting scamed,"I'm an idiot 

Please. Please do not send hate. 

I just want to get this off my chest. I hate myself so much right now. I hate myself more than usually and I don't know if I want to continue living. 

Background about me (24F). I'm a med students in europe. I take loan to pay tuition. I come from a low income family .

This year I was denied a loan and I was using my savings to take me trought my next to last year of uni. I was serching for many online jobb. One job answered. Spoilers. It was a scam. I ended up losing 9 000 euro which is aprox. 9 000 usd (I  think). So my entire savings which was for my semesters tuition and rent money (idk how much tuition is in the US but this would have covert it in europe). I feel like an idiot. I hate myself so much. Why am I so f**king naive. I feel so bad. I feel so horrible. I feel so stupid. My heart hurts so much. I just want to cry. I don't want to continue being alive. I can't express with words how much I hate myself and everything that's has to do with me. 

NOTE: before anyone says I wouldn't want to be treat by a doctor like you who can get scamed out off money. I'm book smart. I'm great with study. I'm emotional smart. I have great empathy and emotional understanding. I am not street smart or whatever this is supposed to be called.

I want to trust people and see the best in them. This quality in me will be my downfall. I hate this about me. How do I become less this and more not this. 

My entire savings I was scamed out off. I dont even have enough for rent or food anymore. I'm trying to sell everything I own while I'm applying to like a billion jobs. I have put up almost all my clothes for sale and my vacuum and my toaster and my old ipad. I don't really own a lot considering I am a poor person. But the little I have I have put it up. I'm currently also looking for a cheaper apartment. Not sure if I can find one considered my rent is under the market value. 

I don't know where I am going with this post. I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

Summery: I (34F) was scamed out of my university tuition. I hate myself now.

depression,1idex31,self imposed crisis,"i think the problem that lays within me is how much my mind taunts me. i personified my mind and see it as separate from who i am. but then again i don’t really know who i am so i end up being convinced of everything “she” tells me. it sounds crazy, i know bc “she” is just my thoughts. but i don’t think i would treat myself like that, so why is my head being mean to me? i know it’s normal to a certain extent. but because of past circumstances and experiences, plus the fact no one has ever revealed my worth or potential to me and i can’t convince myself that i have a lot to live for, i think im stuck believing everything “she” tells me. i used to be so hopeful for the future but even that’s fading and it’s all because of “her”. my mind is so mean to me and i buried myself deep inside of it that even when im told positive things, which is still rare, it’s not enough to make me believe it. and i hate that my mind is part of me and i do all these things “she” tells me would make me feel better, only for “her” to make me feel like crap during and after. i don’t want to dwell on the past bc i do believe that although what i went through sucks, it’s my responsibility to deal with the aftermath. but i can’t cope properly and my head is making things worse by worsening my non existent self esteem and the way i perceive myself. i don’t even perceive myself positively and haven’t for a long time, like years. and i guess that’s normal. but it’s to the extent where i can’t even go outside bc i know all those people will see everything i see. they don’t even have to know me but they sense it. and if they don’t look at me it’s bc im not even worth the acknowledgment. that sounds fricken crazy but i’m so convinced of that. does this make sense? it’s hard and i can’t write it all out in a way that would make sense. it’s gotten to the point where i know i wont amount to anything and i stopped trying so i can find it in my to stop hurting myself and start actually working towards hanging myself, which would be my way to go. it’s hard to live when your mind taunts you everywhere you go and you can’t escape it or have a sense of relief bc she’ll always be there, after each breath or move or word she will tell me something and i’ll believe it bc no one counteracts it. and it’s not their fault, they have their own things and don’t have time to convince me that what my mind tells me isn’t reality. but it’s left me feeling like a terrible person who deserve to be burnt at the stake for all the shitty things i’ve done through out these sixteen years of living. when looking at it objectively (i think) i think i was just being a troubled teenager who made mistakes but i was treated like a monster and a burden and like someone who murdered another person’s family and left them living to witness it. but i didn’t think i was so bad but my mind contradicts it by telling me that if i wasn’t so bad then why do they all still see me like that years later? they all are disappointed in me and they see everything i do. that’s part of the reason why i feel like i can’t live on ",2,2025-01-30 05:54:48,0,1.0,ExplanationMean8389

depression,1idi9od,Idk just venting I guess,"I was molested from the time I can remember by my sister, but it wasn’t her fault completely. She was molested, in turn, she did it to me most of my childhood. We’ve never spoken about it. She’s never apologized. We’re actually close and just act like it never happened. But it does bother me, and I feel like I have resentment towards her because of it. Then around 8-10 my cousin would come visit and he would touch me and tell me not to tell anyone. My father was a drug addict who loved to beat the hell out of me for voicing my opinions about his bad behaviors.. this went on until I was 17. My mom worked so hard to provide for all us that she was never around, so I didn’t really know her that well until my adult life. I also can’t remember a time that i went longer than two years without going to a funeral.. that’s another story though. After my parents finally split up, thankfully, i spent a summer with my dad trying to straighten him up. He had me fooled for two months, and i was so proud of what i had done. I found a cut straw in his house a week before I went back to school. I was so hurt, I tried to end my own life. At only 16. And my aunt said I deserved to be sent off, and I was. For a whole week, and none of my friends from school asked about me. And my mom’s new husband is in prison for raping a girl at this point in time. This is where the crashout version of me comes, I start smoking and drinking and partying. My aunt gave me some alcohol but I promised her I was going straight home. I did not. I met a guy at the river and he forced me to have sex with him in front of his friend. I guess I asked for that one… couple months later, I meet a guy. He’s great! Mom’s husband gets out of prison and I was underage, so I couldn’t be at home when he got there. I was only 16, so I felt like she chose him over me and I had to leave. Well the new guy takes me in. How kind! 24 year old. It was all good, then I find out I have hpv. And the kind that causes cervical cancer, and I have precancerous cells that have been attempted to be obliterated but still persist, and still currently being observed for this. This guy leaves me at that house alone while he goes to strip clubs and bars, etc and I’m too young to go. Mind you when I became of age, he didn’t want to do that stuff anymore. So I never got to live or experience that part of life since he didn’t want me to. Couple years later, working at a food place, trying to be nice and give a coworker a ride home, he robs me, holds me hostage, and does some terrible things to me. I had drugs on me so I couldn’t call the cops. Nothing got done about that either. Couple months later, My sister is pregnant, and then I find out I am too! I lost my baby. She got to keep hers… mind you I can’t have social media so I am isolated from the world. A year later, I have the best thing that ever happened to me. My child saved my life. I’m still with his verbally and mentally abusive father, I’m in a rigorous program trying to better my life, and it’s just hard. I just needed to get that off my chest. I’m sure there’s more I’m missing out on but I have to get up for school in three hours. ",0,2025-01-30 09:08:32,2,0.33,Limp-Taro3852

I'm really not proud of it. all i wanted was comfort yet im still a depressed piece of shit. i just wanted to be happy and enjoy my life like other teens my age.

honestly i feel like i deserve to get abused, since that's what my parents told me. they told me they should've hit me so that i finally start being grateful.. that I'm not depressed, im spoiled and it's in my head. i started wanting to be abused after that, its messed up and i hate being this way.

 i just wanted to feel worthy yet I'm a burden. I'm always anxious and depressed. these meds are the only thing keeping me sane

depression,1idap01,"Why do people treat me like I'm dirt, when all I want to do is help?","So, I've got two kids that are grown(ish) and an EXTREMELY complicated relationship of 14, almost 15 years with a partner who is lackadaisical and doesn't outwardly show affection much. For example, we're not married. But he still is. Remember, we've been together almost 15 years. Why won't he get the divorce? He says it's because he got married in South America and it's difficult to do it from the USA. His wife, i believe, is remarried though. 
So there's that. 
  I have Multiple Sclerosis and it's been flaring like hell lately. Meaning in need help to do things.
   My family recently said they're moving on without me and my youngest daughter who lives with me, has been my carer since 2012 when I fell ill and was in ICU and had Emergency surgery bc I was Septic. Anyway, this included my only brother, his whole family, my niece who's married and just had a baby, she's 1 and me and my youngest haven't met her. ... my nephew, my mother, and my oldest daughter who's in her 30s and getting married this year. They said they didn't want to be involved with ME, my care, therapies, etc. Because it was taking too much time from their lives, so they're mixing forward without us. Don't call, Write, etc. ""Leave them all alone to live their lives.""
Needles to say, I'm beyond hurt.
I try to be a good person
I'm the one who bakes for the whole family at holidays. I'm the one who learned how to make a quilt for my mother's 60th birthday..
. to which she said...(your grandmother's favorite color is purple, mines green)... the quilt was sown by hand... mint green and lavender. I'm the person who babysat my niece and nephew so my brother didn't have to put them in daycare while I switched to nightshift to be able to watch them. I'm the one who took care of my mom during all of her surgeries, illnesses. I was the one who moved back home to take care of my dying grandmother, working 3 jobs taking care of her in the morning and doing tube feeds with her in the evenings until she couldn't anymore. Then we all sat with her at the hospital, me, my mom, and my brother... until she passed. 
So today, if you're still reading.... my youngest got a job.... I'm super thrilled for her. Time to make friends and be social. I'm driving her bc she's not great on the roads. We're talking 5am, lol super early... but whatever. 
So I'm asking her about her day.. she's in training... and what her hours were, realizing we had an appointment that I waited a year to get that will need to be rescheduled now bc I cannot go alone. My partner said
...""just leave her alone and let her settle in to her job, Jesus. ""
And now I'm in the bathroom, writing all this, crying, bc my feelings are hurt
She gets the job.... now I have to figure out how to attend to our huge golden retrievers and take holiday decorations down, put up others, laundry, dinner, and etc. All with no help now when I can barely open and close my hands.....

I had time off, a whole break, and I told myself I’d get things done be productive, maybe even feel better. But now vacation is ending, and I’ve done nothing. Just wasted time, feeling drained and stuck in my head.

I don’t know if this is just burnout, depression, or something else, but it’s frustrating. I want to change, but I can’t even find the energy to start. Does anyone else feel like this? How do you push through when everything feels so heavy?",7,2025-01-29 19:42:11,7,0.9,Think_Tomato_5323
depression,1idajsu,Divorce and loneliness,"I don't know when it happened, but I started to hate being alive, and I hate myself and I hate thinking that I have to spend the rest of my life hating everything.  
I just want to curl up into a little ball and die, starve myself and never achieve anything in life.  
22 years down the drain, all for nothing, I'm tired of being alive.  
My wife left me in September, I wanted to do better for her, I was struggling with work and I was stressed all of the time, I eventually just started putting in the most minimum effort I could manage, and she was tired of it.  
She left me and I've thought about killing her and myself, I shouldn't be allowed to live with how pathetic I am.  
I can't stand living anymore, I don't enjoy anything, and I beat myself up whenever things don't go my way, I lash out at people and I'll never stop.  
I just want to be held and loved, I want to come home to a woman that thinks I'm worth something, even when I don't think I am.  
I'll never believe in myself, and at this rate, no woman would ever find me worthy of love, not enough to be the one to provide me that love at least.  
Idk how much longer I can stand living like this, I've heard it all, I've heard all the methods of how to improve, how to treat myself better, how to be more gentle with myself; it doesn't work.  
I've never loved myself, and I probably never will.

depression,1id3nki,"Chronic head pressure with movement and headaches, blurry vision, freq. urination and excessive thirst. Convinced I will die within the next year.","have been suffering with these symptoms for years now. I decided to go to my gp last year to complain about the symptoms and was told it was just my anxiety. They said that the frequent urination and excessive thirst was because I drank coca cola even though coca cola is a mild diuretic and I was peeing with a full bladder nearly ten times an hour at  worst. I  had blood work done and was tested for just about everything including ANA for autoimmune conditions. Everything was normal except high bilirubin but it's a benign condition called Gilbert Syndrome. The other issue was elevated TSH of 7.5 but she re tested me a couple months later and apparently nothing was wrong?

So flash forward to 2 months ago when Iwent back to my doctor. I begged for an mri of my head because I think i may have IIH/tumour/blood vessel irregularities but she said I won't be able to get an mri because the wait is too long but she said she'll schedule a ct. scan instead. I also got a referral to an endocrinologist from another doctor and he told my gp to schedule appointment ""urgently"".This was nearly 2 months ago and I still haven't heard back about when the ct scan or endocrinoligist appointment will be. 

I think the doctor still believes there is nothing wrong with me and just believes it's all anxiety and I think part of my parents may partly believe this too when I know it's not. They say ""everyone else has problems, they deal with them and go on with their normal lives"" but this makes me feel worse. 

As someone with autism and severe anxiety this entire stretch of my life has made me feel incredibly hopeless, depressed and vindictive. I have panic attacks everyday, I don't go outside, and can't stop thinking and worrying about my symptoms. I now start to feel vindictive when I see people online and in public enjoying themselves because I feel like I can't. I remember how I felt before these symptoms started and how much more joyful I was.

depression,1id9zgr,Please Help My Brother !,"
My brother hasn’t worked in over three years. These days, he spends most of his time in his room. When he wakes up, he eats and then goes back into his room. Every night, he goes to a 24H restaurant to grab a drink. He drinks alone—I know because, for one week, I followed him to see what he was up to.

The brother I used to know was active in sports and loved joking around. Now, he’s become quiet and withdrawn. I’ve tried talking to him to figure out what’s going on, but he just says nothing’s wrong. I don’t want to push him too hard or ask too many questions because I’m afraid it’ll make him uncomfortable.He hasn’t socialized with his friends for the past four years. He only meets up with two of his friends to grab a drink, and that’s maybe once every four months.



I’m from Malaysia, where mental health isn’t taken very seriously. My parents are worried about him not having a job, but whenever I tell them I think my brother might be struggling with mental health issues, they don’t seem to take it seriously.

Please, someone, tell me what I should do. I miss the brother I used to know.

depression,1iczyh3,"My short story? 37M, feeling pretty done. Depression and ADHD.","I just want to speak somewhere. I don't know why.  
I keep saying I don't know lately and it bothers me.  
My life in short was, I was a pretty bright boy, in love with music and skating.   
I started smoking weed young which kind of fucked me over I think.   
I never knew what I wanted to do, was discouraged about music, being told I 'd die poor.  
Years passed, was always told I should do something, and at 23 I studied to be an electrician on a whim.  
I was pretty good and the best student in class. Then I got offered a second subject and I picked hairdressing cause I liked cutting hair?  
I always had depression and thought why should I not become a firefighter which would be awesome and I might die young as a hero?  
Then I had a love failure and while contemplating suicide cause I deemed myself a failure, my father took his life, which was bad, cause while he was a horrible and abusive parent, I never got to meet the good side of him.

I ended up working in hotels during summers, gathering money, and playing video games addictively to ease my pain during the winter.  
Years passed, now I 'm 37, broke, living with my mother, having painful flat feet and a bad lower back which prohibits me from working what I studied.  
I quit my antidepressants methodically cause I couldn't bear the decreased libido and dizziness anymore.  
I developed a passion for singing recently, and have some music written by me, but I don't think I have any energy to continue that anymore.

I recently started working at Teleperformance.  
Every day I regret everything, and I don't feel I have the energy to do anything other than hit the gym.  
And my body's too shit to do standing jobs.  
Do I want to make an OF account and cross my fingers?  
Do I start making Youtube content?  
I 'm not even that fun to be around lately.  
I don't know what I want to do.   
Every night I hope I don't wake up.  
I have 2 cats and some family members that I love and wouldn't love to let them down and spread more pain than my father spread.  
I don't kill myself cause I 'm afraid of the pain and of another sadder life, as I 'm agnostic and believe there might be something out there.  
But I feel like I am done.  
I know for a fact I made very bad choices cause I was stressed and didn't think clearly or anything, and it's coming at me so bad, I can't bear this really.  
I 'm too sad to see a future, and I don't remember much of my past, my present is miserable.

I 'm sorry this was so long, thank you for reading my short story if you did, I hope you 're hanging in there, I wish you the best in life.",7,2025-01-29 18:56:08,0,1.0,Lefterman

depression,1ide6hw,RE: commiseration on distrust,"So, mental illness runs in my family. Sister has a schizo-affective disorder that has ravaged her life and traumatized my family. Her current whereabouts are unknown and that is a source of immense grief for us. My mother is an anxious person, who has had bouts of recurring depression. She, to my knowledge, has never received formal treatment in the way of therapy and/or prescribed medication. I have been dealing with “anxiety and depression” (diagnosed “generalized anxiety disorder”) since my early teens (early 30s now). 

I have received treatment on and off (therapy and prescribed medication) since my teen years. 

Today, I have what one might call a profound distrust of authority. Subsequently, I do not trust that the medical professionals who are sworn to act in my best interest as their patient will in fact do so. 

This isn’t all their fault, I realize. I’m an American, I live in America. I am working-class, at the low-end of the income spectrum. No universal healthcare, can’t afford, or qualify for great insurance. The CEO of my healthcare company was recently assassinated to much acclaim — so that might tell you about the quality of my coverage. So, yes, the treatment that is available to me isn’t exactly world-class to begin with.

That said…

I find the methodologies of available and accessible practitioners to be tired and lazy. They seem not to think critically before diagnosing and then prescribing “appropriate” medication. It seems - on the surface - a dubious practice of trial and error. 

Like, “You seem sad a lot — take this happy pill!”

When I protest, and suggest that maybe I’m sad because I find myself in state of disorganized thinking, unable to focus/prioritize, and unable to sleep — I’m told that there’s a “procedure”. We have to “rule out” depression before we can justify administering a test for ADHD, etc. 

I don’t like feeling like a guinea pig. Over-medicated. I hear horror stories about mis-medication; having your mind neutered and your life thrown further into disarray. And they scare me and foment/sow even more distrust — which, I actually do want to assuage so I can help my “medical team” help me towards stability and self-actualization, yatta-yatta. 

Can anyone relate? Similar journeys? Follow my doctor’s plan and manage my expectations? Eager to hear any thoughts about the matter…

depression,1id444b,"I feel completely trapped, exhausted, and I don’t know how to keep going","I feel like I’m suffocating under the weight of everything in my life right now. I don’t even know how to process it anymore. Every day feels like a loop of exhaustion, frustration, and being completely stuck.

I live with my parents, and it’s mentally destroying me. It’s not constant screaming or anything, but just existing in this environment makes me feel like I’m dying inside.

My mom has cancer. It was caught early, but it still adds to the stress. There’s this unspoken pressure, this heavy atmosphere, and I don’t even know how to handle it.

I want to move out so fucking badly, but I can’t afford it without ruining my long-term financial goals.

Every day in this house makes me feel like I’m losing my mind, but at the same time, I can’t just “get out” without screwing up my entire future.

I tried therapy (three different therapists!) and none of them helped. They gave me “insights,” sure, but nothing actually changed. I still feel just as stuck.

My friends don’t really get it. One of them hasn’t replied all day, and honestly, even if he did, I don’t think his words would change anything.

I don’t have a single place where I feel safe. Even my own room feels like a fucking prison. I hate being here.

I’ve even started hating sleep because this apartment itself feels disgusting to me.

And that’s just the personal side. Work, money, and my ambitions are another nightmare.
I have big goals. I want to move abroad, I want to build something meaningful, I want to create – but I can’t even get my fucking life together right now.

I was supposed to get paid for my work, but the people I worked with have been ghosting me and delaying payments. I have to chase them for money I already fucking earned.

I can’t afford to “just leave” because every penny counts, and losing control over my finances would ruin everything.

My job drains me, but I can’t quit. I need the money, and at this point, work is the only thing keeping me from spiraling further.

I don’t even feel like I have time or energy for myself. It’s just surviving, trying to manage everything, and feeling like I’m failing.

My hair is falling out from stress, and it just makes me feel even worse.

And then there’s her.

There was a girl. I was obsessed with her, and it fucked me up.

It’s over now, but the way it ended still haunts me. I feel like I wasn’t enough, like I didn’t do enough, like I lost before I even had a chance.

I hate that this still lives in my head, but I can’t seem to erase it completely.

I don’t want to kill myself, but I genuinely don’t know how to keep going like this.

I need help. I need someone to fucking get it and tell me how to survive this. How do I deal with this pressure? How do I keep going when I feel like I have nothing left?",3,2025-01-29 21:44:51,2,0.81,DifficultAgent660

I had already hated myself quite a bit but to be honest I didn't really realize how much I did hate myself till recently. If anyone has advice on anything on this list lmk lol.  What's ironic is I hate myself for feeling like I hate myself.  

Things I hate:

 1. myself

2. my nose is so long and takes up my face

3. my skin is brown and I feel like girls won't like me, the group of girls I can talk to are not the same as my friends for example. 

4. my general appearance, I think I'm very ugly 

5. pretty much no work ethic at all and I can't get motivated to do pretty much anything 

6. I'm so needy all the time and I love feeling wanted but don't really deserve to be wanted tbh 

7. I have such an annoying personality I correct people when I should just shut up so much. not because I want to be mean or anything, I just don't even think about it

8. I can't stop talking when I should  

9. I'm so loud, I don't know how to just be quiet and shut-up and I wish I would just shut-up (other people have told me this too)

10. I have no hobbies or interests really. I've tried a bunch but nothing has ever stuck or been something I loved 

11. I don't take nearly as good care of my dog as I could. he deserves such a good life and I know he would be better off with someone else 

12. I never reach out to the people in my life. I never check in and so friends come and go and then I never talk to some again even though they were my life for a while. I suck and I'm so selfish. I love them I don't know why I don't reach out 

13. I need to smoke weed to feel any sense of normalcy in my life day to day and just function

14. I over think everything and drive people away because I know that I annoy the shit out of them with my personality and neediness 

15. I can't seem to save money no matter how much I make, I can't stop getting food and I don't deserve to be buying food so I'm going to stop 

16. I had cancer and so now I only have one testicle at 27 years old and probably can't have kids even though I would love to be a dad so much

17. I care about people so much and because of that I drive them away by asking too much or talking too much

depression,1idcjwu,"I feel stuck , nothing excites me/ motivates me. Please help me","I'm 22, female, living in Australia, and recently married to the man of my dreams. My wedding day was the happiest day of my life in years. I have an amazing partner and supportive parents who love me deeply. But despite all that, I'm feeling lost and stuck.
I have trouble getting out of bed in the mornings, even though l've had enough sleep. My mind knows I need to get up, but I struggle with it. I don't have a morning routine, and my days feel like I'm just waiting for time to pass. I hate my job and don't have any excitement for it, and I don't love being at home either. I often feel like I'm just scrolling on TikTok or waiting for my husband's call.
Even when I try to complete simple tasks like cooking or cleaning, I stop in the middle and end up in bed feeling like I've wasted the day, which just makes me hate myself more. My lost energy shows in my work, and I feel disconnected from the people around me. I used to be very close to my family, but for the past 10 months, l've been anxious about spending time with them. I want to be alone or with my husband, but even then, I spiral into negative thoughts. I can't remember the last time I laughed or felt joy deeply. I am very sensitive to anything my husband does, love and trust him so much but my negatives thoughts scare me sometimes if he doesn't find me attractive forever ( My past relationship I was in toxic relationship with someone for 5 years since I was 15.5 yrs and got cheated on multiple times, physically, mentally and verbally Abbusive and worst breakup)

I have 0 friends always been this way since childhood, I don’t have any hobbies.I struggle to focus on anything, and I get bored really quickly. The only thing I look forward to is talking with my husband about having a baby, but otherwise, I just don't know what to do with myself. I've never thought about ending life before, but lately, the thought of not wanting to live has crossed my mind several times. I just feel stuck.

depression,1idbyzr,Do I have depression or does my life just suck,"\*rant\*

I've talked to psychiatrists and they agree I have symptoms of depression but won't diagnose me because I don't want to kill myself (I have before but don't want to talk about it or be institutionalized). Maybe its just the ADHD? 21F Diagnosed with ADHD and anorexia. Eating disorder is under control now, healthy weight, eating every day. I'm on anti-depressants.

I just can't figure out if I hate my life or I'm not exited about it because I'm depressed. I have actually more friends in my life than Ive ever had before right now. We drink, smoke, play dnd, minecraft, we have a dog, I'm about to graduate college with a degree I like. I have a car, I eat good food, I workout 2-3x a week, sleeping enough (mostly).

Now for the bad. The love life has been dry as fuck for a long time. No one I like likes me back, I don't know how to enjoy relationships or people anymore. I feel so terrible but its felt like a chore for a long time. I'm trying to talk to dudes on hinge and plan dates but I'm not going to lie I don't know how to be invested when I'm so tired. My degree is difficult and labor intensive and the grind every day sucks. I barely have the energy to get out of bed and forcing myself to go to class every day. I'm being so serious I constantly wish I was laying down. I'm constantly rushing to get assignments in because I can't plan for shit. 

I hate my job and almost everyone there, I will say it doesn't require too much work though which I like. I like the gym and want to go more but managing to get there is the hardest thing in the world just because I have to plan around work and school and friends. I can't keep my room clean, my roommates will hate me and talk behind my back if I forget about my chores. I lose my keys or wallet every three days or so.

No one in my life knows about the eating disorder so they don't know why I've been a zombie for the last 8ish months (starving 24/7) and Ive sort of been neglecting those relationships because of it. I'm actively trying to fend off a developing weed addiction. I'm trying to pay down credit cards by donating plasma which makes me even more tired. I am in so much credit card debt and have student loans I'm constantly worried about.

Maybe its just how your 20s are, but I would love to have the mental space to actually enjoy my friends and have like one hobby or something so I can feel like I'm enjoying my life at all. My life is pretty normal for my age I'm aware, but is my lack of enjoyment chemical? A mindset issue?

I had tried everything I was on meds talked to a therapist but I never told her how I really feel and I was a recluse but weed just completely changed everything so I started smoking everyday which seemed to make my suicidal thoughts go away for a little(enough time for me to get better) and I never really recovered from depression idk if you can but I was still sad but it was better and life was looking good but I also stopped talking to my mom and her side of the family and I feel so bad.

I’m a terrible person and I’ve deserved all that I have caused but I don’t even feel depressed anymore I don’t feel any type of emotional at a given time other than like anxiety and paranoia almost in a worse spot then where I was but I’m alive and don’t know what to do with myself I don’t think anyone will care if I die I just want to be left alone for the rest of my life at this point I don’t bring anything good to the world. ,1,2025-01-30 03:20:57,0,1.0,LetTasty9135

depression,1icu3e8,Why bother?,"
Hi,

Lately, I’ve been struggling to find a reason to keep pushing forward. I don’t want to bring children into this world and pass on the burden of existence. Since I’m already posting this, I guess I belong to the group of people who will never find a good partner in life—I’m just different.

Now, I have nothing to look forward to. I exist only to pay taxes, just another cog in the machine. I’ve tried to build friendships, but they always end up feeling transactional—I only get contacted when someone needs something from me. It’s disheartening, and I’m struggling to find a reason to keep trying.

I feel paralyzed. I know I’m the only one who can help myself, but I just don’t see a good ending to any of this.

depression,1idbi1x,The pain of giving up and succumbing to your inevitable eternal isolation.,"When you realize you were always the one no one wanted around as much. When you look back and remember the birthdays you weren't invited to, and the time your had to go to the other kid's parent to get you invited. High school was incredibly lonely; the people you hung out with at church never even spoke to you outside of organized events (I'm atheist now).  You were lonely in college, too. Only had your work friends, more people forced to tolerate your presence, until they didn't anymore. 

It was because you were a fat, ugly, audhd, monster. But even after you got ghosted and pushed away by the mirror of yourself who, on paper, should've liked you. But even they didn't want anything to do with your worthless ass. One message every two-three weeks is too much of you for anyone to have to bear.

Even after you lost weight, nothing changed. You're still the monster left over. The last choice. The one people will never message first. The one they'll have to settle for. 

There's no point if trying if no one will ever make time for you. It's better to shut yourself off to everything and everyone. If everyone you love will end up choosing someone better, or treating you like an empty coffee cup meant to be thrown away, there's no use. 

It's time to accept you'll be alone until you die. Isolated and left to stew in the pain of knowing rejection awaits everywhere you would ever go. Left to drown your sorrow and depression in video games, food, and alcohol. 

Everyone else doesn't care about you, so they must be in the right. What's the point in caring about yourself? You have no worth. You're a disgusting, piece of trash, lonely monster. Your companionship is poison and your simple presence is enough for people to run from you, even when you've only been kind to them. 

I deserve the pain and the isolation. I'm a fucking worthless germ that should die. ",1,2025-01-30 03:10:25,0,1.0,Negative-Leg-5412

depression,1idbaot,Help me,"Please help

Hello, I am pretty new to posting on reddit so please bear with me.

I just started community college in September of 2024. I am currently majoring in psychology. When the semester started I was doing great, and I kept up with my work and attendance efficiently. When late November started to hit, I started getting depressed because of the weather and stress being built up from school, work and having to take care of a home pretty much by myself. I suck at telling stories so this may seem a little bit choppy and hard to keep up with. My mother is bipolar and she is constantly working so that leaves me with daily cleaning and also taking care of my cats. This slowly but surely threw me into a depression. I stopped going to school completely and I didn't care to check and see what the status was on my credits, let alone checking to see if I had failed 5 out of my 5 courses. Ive been stuck in a hole of depression for a couple of months now and the spring semester just started. I don't want to drop out because I would have to pay back a bunch of money and I also don't know if Ive genuinely been kicked out. Ive been too scared to check. I probably should've checked before I made this post but I just need some advice, or some help.

I want to go back to when I truly felt happy, truly felt like I belong and truly felt like I was wanted by others. 

I'm so sick and tired of feeling tired, feeling down, feeling burned out and just feeling lost. I have no idea where I'm going in life anymore. All of my plans have come to nothing. All of my wants have fizzled out and my drive to improve myself is non existent. 

I feel like the last few years have been so full of bad things that I just can't keep going anymore incase something else happens. The hope that good will come is so overshadowed by the fear that something else is going to go wrong. 

From severe life threatening illness that put me in intensive care, to losing my job, to being blocked from a career path that I've trained my entire life for due to the covid lock down and companies in that career path seemingly no longer hiring, at least not at a pay rate that anyone living alone can survive on.  

To financial struggles, legal battles over being sold faulty goods (my previous cars engine failed 3 days into owning it and the company who sold it blocked me when I asked for a refund/help) so now I'm down over £3000.

To the feeling of having to rely on family for what feels like everything, having to borrow money off of my mother and father, having to lean on them for support when all I want is to be able to support myself. 

The only positive thing that happened last year was that I got a somewhat decent job, however, it's a fixed term position so, even though they are saying they're certain that funding will be granted to keep me on, I'm having doubts... what if it gets to March and they can't and have to let me go, then I'm stuck, no job, no money saved due to these legal battles etc, and no one I can fall back on due to money I already owe to family... 

I'm honestly so tempted to just give up and ""exit"" life. 

I feel so drained. So lost. So helpless. 
Even talking to people is becoming harder, I just feel so socially stuck, I feel like om boring, I feel like I'm awkward and just not someone people want to be around, which is only reinforced by the amount of people who have seemingly dropped out of my life the past few years... and those who have come in seem to usually only remain in my life for a brief few days-weeks before moving on. Some haven't left, but most seem to. I truly appreciate anyone who has stuck around in my life.

I just, I don't know what to do anymore.

depression,1id86hs,I'm having a really hard time,"I'm really not doing well and I feel like my mental health is just getting worse day by day and idk what to do. I've literally no friends and I feel like I'm a terrible person because most of my friendships break up after a year or two and my sister keeps telling me it's not my fault but how is it the I'm the only person who has no friends but the people who fucked me over are doing completely fine. what if I'm the problem and people just keep lying to me to spare my feelings because how is this possible that I'm the one who always lose friends. maybe I'm a little too sensitive and like playing the victim all the time.

for context I had a friend grp in a levels but my so called best friend fucked me over(I had to skip a month of school because of retakes and during that time she got really close with a girl who would talk shit about me and would never take my side when I wasn't around and when I would confront her she would take the other girl's side instead so I dropped her) and due to which I lost that whole friend grp and then in the other friend grp this guy talked down to me and I realised he didn't respect me so I separated myself from that grp. after a levels I only had one friend from a levels due to all this shit and we stayed friends in uni. 

then in uni this one girl in my friend grp would constantly belittle me and make me feel like shit so I decided to distance myself from her and it all just went to shit(you can check my profile for the whole thing).

so now I'm completely friendless and it has got me thinking that something is wrong with me. now for context I've severe depression, anxiety and add (all professionally diagnosed when I was in middle school) and I used to be on prozac but I stopped taking it because it stopped working for me. so currently I'm not on meds and I feel like that's making things worse but I plan on goig to a psychiatrist soon. 

but still the main thing that's been bothering me is that I think I'm a horrible and unlikable person that's why people always fuck me up but in reality I'm the one whose at fault but I've such a huge victim complex that I make myself out to be a victim in every situation even if I'm not. I mean how much can I put on my mental health and at one point I've to admit maybe I'm the problem. 

has anyone else with mental health issues ever been though this and if so how do you tell what's your fault and what isn't? because I feel like the people around me are biased and lying to me.

TL;DR: I keep losing friends and feel like I’m the problem. I have depression, anxiety, and ADD, was on meds but stopped. Planning to see a psychiatrist, but I wonder if I have a victim complex. How do you tell what’s your fault vs. what’s not?

depression,1id7hbh,Need info 😭 n Celexa withdrawls...,"Greetings. With my docs approval, I slowly tapered off the Celexa in the last week. I'm taking Wellbutrin as well, but my case has been stable and that was the last med added. I've been in it for two years. Of course I first tapered down....cutting that tiny 3mm pill in half for four days, then down to 1/4 for four days. The mild ""flash head spins"" (what I call them) and slightly down mood are the only side effects of quitting so far. How long is that going to continue before I'm otherwise back to my baseline? I don't want to assess the success of my cessation until the withdrawal are all done. Please don't answer unless you've got experience with this or you've talked to a doc or pharm about it. Nothing personal, but some people love yo hear themselves talk, and like to answer questions they don't know the answer to. Thank uou. Now, that being said.......

It's rant time! Of course I originally called the pharmacist and they told me to cut the pill down gradually. I said ""I already told you I did that. It'll be impossible to cut it down any smaller."" So then the guy repeats himself. He just didn't get it that after you 100% quit, you are going to have withdrawls. I just wanted to know how long they'd go on. Grrrr!

depression,1id7am8,I'm so sick of life,"Words cannot express how much I've been pushing myself, always telling myself at some point it'll be good, and I am reminded of that by having the tiniest taste of something nice which always gets fucked up somehow, or something else goes horribly in my life. I hate how I had kidney problems since birth and literally took ungodly amounts of medicine to keep me alive meanwhile I was told I wouldn't even make it to 12 years old. I hate how I managed to survive and got everything I have now which I don't deserve a single thing of since I hate who I am.

All my past relationships have been shit and any time I try I'm hurt one way or another. I've given up on finding 'the one' since one way or another I'm so incompatible with people that my family name and genetics die with me.

Yet I always have a mask on, always going with the flow of emotion. Not being able to explain to any one how I feel. And when I let my guard down and I talk about my true feelings, I'm either called, ""Pesimistic"" ""Depressing"" ""Weird"", or the person even leaves, and at all of the cases I regret letting the person know how I feel.

I hate how I abuse drugs to the point most convectional ones like alcohol, nicotine, alcohol, etc. are losing their effects, which makes me scared that my feelings are going to get worse and somehow I lose everything I don't even deserve.

I hate how I tried to take my life and every time it failed I had to live with the shame of failure and the judgement and disappointment in me of the people around me. I hate how I've been locked in a psych ward on suicide watch because I failed one too many times.

depression,1id6pib,why am I like this,"The way I feel emotions is so weird and it doesn't make any sense to me, it frustrates me knowing there's something wrong with me by I don't know what. Knowing if I get a diagnosis then I'll finally know I'm not just crazy. It's hard to explain, but most of the time I'm not happy or sad, I'm just here. I dont even really notice it. But when I do get sad I get really sad, same with any other emotion. When I do feel it, I feel it so intensely. This has always happened from since I was little, but I didn't really think much of it. It's starting to get in the way of my everyday life now though, which is why I'm here posting this. About 30 minutes ago i ended a really bad crash out. I had felt so alone the whole day, even more than usual. None of my friends were reaching out, nothing was going on, I was just alone. So already being in a state of emptiness, I wanted to take it easy. I went to play music on my tv around 2 hours ago, which it wouldn't work. It just simply wouldn't open, I got frustrated but I was going to take it easy. I decided to factory reset my tv. I'm setting it back up, it asks me to put in the Wi-Fi password and so I did, and it kept saying it was wrong, when I knew it wasn't. This was just the beginning. I decided to just give up with it so I wouldn't further anger myself, so I shut off my tv. I sat at the edge of my bed, I felt so so alone and so empty, It was like nothing mattered anymore and there was no point in trying anymore. After around 10 minutes of just sitting there, I decided to play music through headphonesc which all of them were dead. I started to get pissed, but still trying to keep my cool. I decide to just try to set up an old speaker, which also doesn't work out for me. In that moment I was so angry and so sad. Nothing was working out for me. I started bawling out of nowhere and I couldn't stop, no matter what I did. Then everything that ever went wrong in my life hit me all at once making my emotions intensify. This had felt like the lowest I've ever been. This is just one experience I've had, things like this happen but not all the time. I have sudden bursts of intense emotions and everything hits me at once and I feel like the end of the world is happening and it makes me want to cry but scream but also just laying here and stare into the ceiling for hours doing nothing but it also makes me want to ghost everyone in my life. I just don't know what's up and I don't want to deal with whatever is going on with me anymore.

I feel alone everyday I struggle deeply with depression,anxiety, anger and a lot of the subgroups that come from those things. The start of everything was when my mother died when I was 9 and my father when I was 14, my life was rough before either passed but of course things got harder after. I grew up an only child but I do have a sister on my father side who hates me just for being born (I’ve only been around her 3 times my whole life) if you’re wondering how they died my mother took her life from alcohol and narcotics and my father died drunk in the passenger seat of his car while his girlfriend (also drunk) attempted to bring them home but she’s still alive. None of it ever made sense but life goes on and I had to drag myself through all of it, I barely have any connection to family I only have an aunt and grandmother. My aunt feels I’m a victim blaming bum who can’t get my life together my grandmother doesn’t feel that way I guess she has a stronger measure of love for me. Regardless, everyday for me for years has been miserable I have suicidal ideation all the time I even attempted to strangle myself in my teen years but I didn’t follow through. I currently live with my grandmother btw this is my moms mother, she’s helped me the but we’re both extremely poor I do have a job but I struggle bad with saving funds because I spend a good portion of my check on weed. My priorities have been fucked for a long time but this drug is the only thing that’s kept me sane all this time since 14 I am addicted I can admit but I also don’t know how to live without being high I don’t know how to cope with my everyday life and what I lost. Im constantly reminded how young I am and how much life I may have ahead but in the same breath my parents are dead and I have no family dynamic I’m very lonely all the time and trying to build relationships (with women) has been one of the biggest challenges til this day.

mentalhealth,1gd9l9c,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)

mentalhealth,1e297nd,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

When I was 16, I was confident, and had a clear path mapped out in my head. I didn't get offended easily, and didnt get that affected by bad news. I knew the world could be cruel, but I was certain the good overweighed the bad, and was quick to bounce back. I was eager to grow up, and wanted to move out, even at the age of 16 (I wasnt allowed of course, but the motivation and drive was there).

Now, as a 24 year old, I feel less adequate and prepared for life compared to back then. I easily cry, I get anxious over nothing, and I shut down when confronted with problems I used to handle well.

mentalhealth,1ienlq2,My family is at a loss… please help.,"To start off with, my brother is 22. He was finally diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and narcissistic personality disorder who also has a small chance of becoming schizophrenic per doctors notes. He’s been seeing a NP for a while and didn’t believe her because “she doesn’t know what she’s talking about” so my mom got him in with a person who analyzes his behavior, has him take a test and everything and it has come to this conclusion. We thought we got an answer, great right? No. My brother said he’s a liar and it isn’t true. The doctor prescribed meds for him and we actually all noticed a difference, but then saw him resorting back to his old behavior.
We were raised in a very loving home, my mom especially has been so supportive of all of us but she has been there for my brother EXTENSIVELY. He has gotten fired from multiple jobs because he would just not show up, or think he could leave whenever and is coming very close to getting fired from his job now as they talked with my parents. He tried flying to Russia and even went as far as the JFK airport for a girl he was “in love” with, meanwhile this time was the height of the war over there with Ukraine even as my mom sobbed and begged him to not go because she was worried for his safety. After this he got an actual girlfriend, he was taking his meds and actually doing really well but I noticed he would constantly bicker with her about him being right and he had no motivations and would get annoyed when she would ask which is when it started getting very toxic, they both were, so they broke up. I noticed he started resorting to his old behavior, staying in his room, eating a lot, risk taking behavior, being very mean to everyone who tried to help, etc. He then went to college with my mom helping his loan and would fail a class, then say he won’t do it again and then failed 3 more times. Through this my mom has been supporting him, taking him to appointments, talking to his doctors, setting him up with therapy, constantly checking in with him and talking to him, etc.

So here we are today, this has been building but I truly think it’s the worse it’s ever been. He completely stays in his room all the time, has been gaining an extensive amount of weight by constantly eating, ignoring us all, not taking showers because he doesn’t think he needs to, doesn’t talk when we try to involve him, constantly lies to us all and doctors, and actually has been lying for a month about taking his meds but told me yesterday he’s been just throwing them away and lying to my mom as she sets them out and reminds him, and also has been lying about going to therapy (which my mom pays for) and just driving somewhere else for the timeframe and honestly just treats my mom like absolute shit.

I've been cutting for a while now, and I feel like this really distracts the urge. 

Anyways, after I tell the person about my jars, this other guy says, wow you really are a mentally ill psycho. I don't know why but that made me really start questioning my sanity. The meaning of insanity is doing the same thing over and over. After that it was just really awkward. I try to appear low-key. I'm to scared to wear shorts and t shirts because of scars, and people calling me a psycho. Am I insane? Thank you listening to my rant. 

Edit: thank you all so much for your responses, I was definitely overthinking. I will keep filling my jars full of stars",104,2025-01-30 21:49:34,44,0.99,pepto_bismol99

mentalhealth,1iel71d,Finding it hard to open up to others,"Hello. Some context - I run a mythic raiding guild in WoW, and last night we were raiding and I had a really rough start to the night. I had owned up to my mistake and a few of my guildmates innocently made some jokes about the other night which I apparently didn't like too much and I lashed out at one comment in particular. I messaged that person after and apologized for lashing out and that person was really kind about it. They checked up with me and I explained how I wasn't doing too well these past few weeks. I didn't play well the rest of the night and it was clear something was up with me.

I messaged them this morning and just mentioned how I appreciated their kind words to which they said they're always around to talk. I've been seeing a therapist recently and they mentioned to me to expand my support system. I have one really good friend who I tell almost everything and I would like to open up a little to this person however, I guess I'd feel bad about it. I don't really like opening up to people as to me it feels like I'm dumping my problems onto them.

In the case of the one friend I've told everything, I honestly can't remember why or how it all came out but that's a special case. I would like to share a bit with this person just to have someone else to talk to but I don't know how to do it without feeling like I'm dumping everything onto them or overwhelming them when they probably already have their own problems to deal with.

I was of course, just like anyone else would do, was watching trying to see what all the chaos was about. anyways they turn to me and publicly shame me telling me to mind my own business before agin I even got a chance to react. the person I'm with whom shall not be named, forces me to stay there by holding on to my hand tightly as so I couldn't leave then precede to talk over me consistently and as a result I wasn't able to explain to others what the situation was. later on I heard them talking behind my back to some o their friends basically saying I'm an idiot and blah, blah, blah. when I called them out on it they basically said I'm making them look bad and turning it into something that its not? when that's literally what happened. there's plenty other examples of this in my life, but for now I'll stick to this one example unless asked by someone in the comments. much love and peace",1,2025-01-31 22:44:49,0,1.0,These_Speed9118

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want people assuming I don’t appreciate the job I have. I do. There are so many things I’ve been able to do because of it. But I am SO lonely. I feel like my mental health is really suffering. I’m 27 years old and I can barely get myself to leave the house without my husband. I used to love driving or window shopping alone and now the thought of just checking the mail makes me break out in a sweat. I often can’t organize my thoughts and feel like an emotional wreck. I’ll go from laughing at funny videos to suddenly balling my eyes out hysterically over nothing. 

We recently moved states so I have no friends here. My family is back home and I have no idea how to get the energy to try and go out to make friends. I guess im really just venting. I know remote work is so sought after right now and I’m living a lot of peoples ideal situation but I feel like it’s almost ruined me. 

I’ve lost my independence. I don’t know how to be me anymore. It feels like I have no worth. My job doesn’t even require me to make phone calls so it’s just me in silence or listening to music all day long. I have absolutely nothing to contribute when my husband comes home from work. There’s nothing ever to talk about so it’s just him sharing his day with me and I can’t input anything useful.

mentalhealth,1iek4fu,Where do these self doubts come from?,"For example, I've always had good grades in school and most of the time when I did something in my life I suceeded. Plus, my parents always have assured me that they will love me and be proud on me no matter what.

However, it doesn't really feel like it was me who achieved things and I'm not really proud on my accomplishments, it more feels like luck to me and like I don't deserve to be happy about it.
Also my self-confidence is really low. No matter where I go or what I do I'm always scared that people might think I'm weird or something. And others notice these insecurities, I've been told (very nicely) by various people that I shouldn't be so shy, but I just can't talk about myself like I would talk about someone I like or admire.
With every move I do it just feels like I'm an attention seeker. I feel the constant urge to downplay myself.

I have this since ever (I'm 15 now), but it's gotten much worse over the past year. And as I said, I really have no clue where these self doubts come from.

mentalhealth,1ieg58c,"21F, just ended a relationship with 36M. I’m only attracted to men significantly older than me. I don’t know what to do.","Why can I not find men my age attractive?

Looking for advice on what to do about this - I've literally never been attracted to guys my age, only older than me. I couldn't ever find anyone attractive throughout my teen years aside from men significantly older than me.

Preface by saying I've beenprofessionally diagnosed with: Autism Spectrum Disorder ADHD OCD Generalized Anxiety Disorder

It's been this way since I was very young as I viewed everyone my own age as 'children'(which they were because I was under 18) and found that unattractive that they looked younger and wanted to be with someone older.

Obviously they wouldn't enter a relationship with me as a child so I had no serious romantic relationships until 19 when I met a 34 year old man.

Prior to this I went on two 'dates' which just included long walks and chatting, with a 33 year old man but he ended contact and nothing romantic occurred, for the best I believe.

I just left a relationship with the same man I mentioned meeting earlier whom is now 36 years old after 18 months. We met when I was 19 and he has 34. I didn't view the age gap as 'bad' because in my eyes I could finally be with someone who I genuinely felt attraction for and could experience a relationship.

I realise now he was subjecting me to narcissistic abuse and there were many red flags which I didn't see at the time, until I finally shared what was happening with other people in the last week. I didn't tell anyone for fear of ruining HIS reputation haha.

I posted on a text subreddit about my situation with my now ex and there is so many comments saying why don't you just date your own age. Which I completely understand because that is normal!

But even if I find someone my age who I feel any sort of 'connection' with, the fact that they're my age and not a lot older than me means inevitably they won't look 30-40.I have no physical attraction to them and that is an element of a relationship.

Having experienced a lot of traumatic events such as the death of my father at 19, being stalked, raped and hospitalised etc means I struggle to connect with people who haven't had similar traumatic experiences which a lot of people experience later in life. I've been in therapy since 11, had a year of DBT for emotional dysregulation which was later attributed to ADHD.

I'm staying single now because if I date someone older I'm putting myself at risk as I am 21.

TLDR: 21F never been attracted to people my own age, dated a 34 year old at 19 for 18 months and just left him, I've just realised how horrific the relationship was. Want to know why I don't find anyone my age attractive and if others have experienced this. ",3,2025-01-31 15:35:47,7,0.71,deerwillow

I was in survival mode growing up and didn’t really want a job I just wanted to feel safe. Going away to college meant moving away from my emotionally immature parents which is what I needed. Moving away helped me heal in a lot of ways and finally feel safe. Through therapy and finding a supportive partner it really helped me. Over the years I had a few job experiences and they took a large toll on my mental health. Anytime I would try to have a part time job I found myself having immense anxiety I didn’t want to mess up because if i did it would result in harsh criticism, but it kinda became a self-fulfilling prophecy, because I would be so anxious that it was like I was in freeze mode managers would view me as stupid or feel like they had to tell me what to do every 5 minutes. Which would result in passive aggressiveness and harsh criticism until I would eventually quit or break down in a panic, sometimes my throat closing up. I stopped working for a while because at the time I didn’t need to and I could just focus on my studies. Now I only have a few months to find a job that can support me enough to split rent with my boyfriend or I have to move back home (different state) and move back in with my abusive parents.

mentalhealth,1iefaw2,"Advice on how to help bipolar best friend - hypomanic, moody, isolating self","Hi!
My very close friend is diagnosed with bipolar, and has recently been struggling a lot with the diagnosis and its symptoms - he is fully unmedicated just for context. In the last few months or so, he has been in a rather tumultuous romantic relationship with a girl I barely know, and she mistreats him a lot. They’ve broken up multiple times, but always seem to find the way back to each other - I think they both enjoy the chase a lot, and I suspect that the depressive episode he’s been in recently might make him act impulsively, as his relationship with her is very emotionally intense. His depressive episodes usually leave him feeling very empty, and I suspect that the reason he keeps going back is to simply feel something. Anyway, he has recently started distancing himself from me a lot, and acting very diffrently - being very short with me, taking a lot of distance from me, super irritated/ moody, and very obviously unhappy. It’s had quite a big impact on me as we’re very close and spend a lot of time together, and i’m just feeling unsure on what to do, and writing here to seek guidance. 

I know from earlier ”episodes” that he has a hard time replying to messages/ SMS (It can be very overwhelming for him at times) but I was considering just writing him a message saying that I love and support him, and that if there’s anyhing he needs from me I’d love to help & that i know he’s not mad at me, just having a hard time regulating his emotions. I’d want to tell him that i’ll be taking some distance from him this weekend as I assume he needs some alone time, (we typically do everything together) but if he wants i’d love to meet up/ if there’s anything he’d want to talk about that i’m always here for him, and finally that he doesn’t need to reply incase it feels overwhelming and to just take his time.

Does this seem like a reasonable course of action, or should i try to keep a closer eye on him? 
This is naturally difficult for anyone here to tell me, but as someone without bipolar i’d love to get some insight on how others feel that have been in similar situations. I love him more than anything and I really just want to be as much help as i possibly can. Thank you so much.",2,2025-01-31 14:55:24,0,1.0,No-Ganache-413

I will eventually fall asleep again but something else occurs before I do. I'm not asleep or awake at this point, it feels like I'm too tired to move, as if paralysed and in my head I hear the loudest white noise for what feels like two or three minutes straight, but who knows how long it actually is? It's like someone turned an old TV on in my head with that horrible static noise. It gets louder and louder and I am conscious during this time, worried about what is happening. And during this time, I hear other noises along with this staticness, a convincing sound that someone is unlocking and opening my front door and the sound of footsteps can be heard around my apartment, sometimes even the sound of talking. Sometimes it sounds like my mother, sometimes it's the voice of a stranger, which is always male. And then I fall asleep, I won't remember falling asleep or the moment the sounds fade.

I tried looking up what this could be but it doesn't really sound like whatever other people have experienced during exploding head syndrome, so I'm trying to find out what this is.

Anyways the main problem, i snap in the morning first thing before even fully waking up or thinking about anything, now it doesn't happen everyday and I THINK it's because of the crying on mornings  I don't get great sleep. But I haven't been able to like completely pinpoint if that's the trigger.

She says I have to go today and implied that if I don’t she doesn’t want to have to get me that assesment in a less willing way.so I have to go to emerge to see a psychiatrist apparently and I’m concerned they will put me as an inpatient. That’s obviously a horrible thing that I do not want and do not have the time to do. Can someone tell me wtf is going on because I’m genuinely confused.

mentalhealth,1iee2wl,Luvox for OCD and worry about cognition,"Hello

After quite some time of Exposure and Response Therapy and a lot of wins, I got prescribed Luvox (100mg) by my psychiatrist to help me with the symptoms that keep making my life pretty hard even though I learned to disengage with obsessions 19/20 times. 

My fear with the medication is the following: I'm someone who values his intelligence and cognitive abilities a lot and I'm afraid that it might somehow make me less smart, or cognitively impaired in some way. 

As far as the scientific literature goes, there could be some short term effects on cognition like foginess (while your body adapts to the medication) but in the long term there should be no impact on intelligence & cognition. There are even some who suggest that the contrary might be the case and the medication helps you boost cognition in a sense by lifting all the pressure from anxiety. 

What got me worried now, is that when I don't search for papers, or scientific evidence and go for user experiences on reddit a.k.a googling ""cognition and fluvox-reddit"" I get quite some comments like ""fluvox made me dumber"" ""fluvox made me lose my memory"" etc. 

It might very well be that they are outliers and I'm having selection bias (as in, only people with problems will write in a subreddit titled cognition and Luvox). 

I would like to hear your opinion & or experience.

My reason to deny the antidepressants is because I am on a lot of medication already and would like to try and talk it out first. 

Sorry for the long post but my question is have I been diagnosed with PTSD?

I just hate these kind of nights. It's these kind of nights that make me want to try to go away again. I know how that went last time, I will not do it again. I will keep on pushing forward and fighting. I am going to get better. I'm taking classes again in college and I'm gonna kick ass and graduate this time and actually be able to live by myself without all of my loved ones worrying whether or not I can be safe.

It's been a long journey, but these cold winter nights still really suck. I have no one to talk to and I just sit here in my room, smoking some weed, doing absolutely nothing. I wish I had friends, but with all my mental health drama these past few years there has been time for socialization, just doctors appointments and medications and being depressed for weeks upon weeks.

I guess I just really need friends but Idk that's a whole other issues, like I'm so boring no one is gonna wanna befriend me; I have no hobbies. I just wish the loneliness would go away so I could be happy with my life.",6,2025-01-31 03:35:09,4,1.0,Particular-Arm2288

I had to move schools for financial reasons and am now living at home. I still have a good amount of friends here and my friends call me every day to check up on me but for some reason this time around I feel so alone. I think maybe because this has been going on for so long I get scared that maybe I’m annoying the people around me by talking about it so much. I’m dealing with feeling used, manipulated, worthless, all alongside the feeling of loneliness. And it’s weird because I feel alone but I know I have people who support me.

mentalhealth,1ied4fu,Suspicion of DID,"I am 18 and have diagnosed adhd, OCD and CPTSD. I am obviously not here to get a diagnosis but I would just like some insight or advice. I do have a psychological evaluation once i turn 19 but i am only here asking for advice to 1. Prepare for my evaluation and 2. I struggle with imposter syndrome quite often and need more judgement besides my own. 

Okay to get to the point for over a year now i have been suspicious that I may have DID and my suspicion only grows with the passage of time. 

I will not go into detail but i have had quite the traumatic past/childhood and Ive always experienced disassociation but recently ive had more and more periods of time where i just completely forget everything that's happened and often come out confused and remember nothing. Most notably in November of 2024 i remember nothing from the entire month and was told by my family and partner that I was acting differently than usual, there have also been shorter occasions of this such as periods of a few hours to days.

 I also struggle to recognize my body as my own. Somedays i feel like me and somedays things feel off and wrong and that i should look different but not in a way i specifically know. As well as mood swings and changes in speech + personality?

Another thing to note is that i occasionally experience what i thought to be auditory hallucinations but they sound like vague overlappimg voices as well as occasional visual hallucinations. I also often completely blank when being spoken to and do not pick up anything being told to me resulting in having to ask the person to repeat themselves.

 Those are just a few things that make me suspicious of having DID. I would like some sort of confirmation that my suspicion isn't a stretch and is somewhat of a reasonable thing to suspect and possibly what i should expect for my evaluation.",1,2025-01-31 12:56:39,0,0.99,caninething

I have struggled all my life with mental health, but following an event a few years ago it upped to uncontrollable suicidability.

But I don't understand any health professional due to past history. I am someone that likes to know what's happening as when this all got so much worse police gave incorrect data about me and even when the police wrote to the hospital to correct their mistake it wasn't corrected. 

So medical records after that seemed to have more and more errors and if I questioned it I seem to be an enemy. 

Over time these staff opinions and errors have grown and the errors seeming malicious (false stigmatised diagnosis and accusation of violence toward staff). 

It's now impossible for me to talk to any health professionals for fear of them reading and believing the completely undocumented diagnosis or accusation or what the police said. 

Needing to seek both mental and physical help currently and too terrified and just end up in crisis but unable to reach out to anybody.

mentalhealth,1iecvo6,Am I overreacting?,"So for context I am a 1st year nursing college student. Today, in my health assessment class, we had a new clinical instructor since we get a different one every two lectures. When our clinical instructor arrived, she seemed like she was the bubbly big sister type so everyone was at ease. After that we were then asked to introduce ourselves and share why we chose this particular course. As everyone took their turn, she acknowledged them and made comments on their answers.

I tend to get nervous and shaky when speaking in front of people, even if I don't feel nervous. So, I practiced what I was going to say beforehand. When my turn finally came, I gathered all my courage to speak-only to realize that the instructor wasn't even looking at me. She was focused on her list instead. Unlike with my classmates, she barely acknowledged my response and made only a brief comment.

At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking I might be overanalyzing. But not being looked at while speaking made me feel like I wasn't being taken seriously or acknowledged at all, and that really hurt. Especially since l've always struggled with putting my thoughts into words.
After a while during the oral recitation, she was warm and encouraging to my classmates, responding to each of their answers with ""very good"" with a smile on her face. But when it was my turn, l gave a response straight from the textbook (my answer was correct, it was also stated in her powerpoint presentation) yet she barely acknowledged it. Instead of affirming my answer, she simply asked, ""what else?"" It felt as if my response wasn't enough. Then, when another student answered after me, she finally said ""good."" It seemed like I wasn't being acknowledged in the same way as the others.

I might sound overly sensitive and stupid but for me there was definitely a subtle bias or a hidden animosity at play. Anyways, I felt like my energy was sucked out of me and tears were forming (haha). I was supposed to be doing good now and participating more in class since I am the shy type of person but now I feel like I’m back to 0.

my dad turns a blind eye to this. he allows my brother to attend therapy (my brother won’t go) but i don’t think he’s getting the right therapy. he needs someone who specializes in autism. i’ve told my dad this a million times since i was 10, alongside many family members. he ignores it. a part of me is angry that my brother won’t attend the therapy, because i know change can be hard for people with autism. but i don’t know how to support him in getting help if he won’t help himself. then i feel bad, because my brother doesn’t understand how therapy will help himself emotionally because he’s autistic. it’s a never ending loop.

mentalhealth,1ieb3u8,My life sucks and everything feels unfair,"Hi everyone 

I have suffered from severe depression, anxiety, ptsd, etc for nearly a decade now and throughout that time I had nearly any friends and nearly a social life. In Comparison to my siblings my social life was 10 out of a 100%. I always had 2 really good friends and even with them I nearly was in contact. I tried after school activities but I stopped after a couple of weeks because of my anxiety and depression. I also felt so lonely throughout that time and with the years I had more good friends but I kept them at arm length because I didn’t want them to see the „real“ me basically the mentally ill me, I was ashamed for the fact that I was mentally ill, I went through CSA from the age 3-10 and I had a lot of stored shame and my mother made it worse because she is a narcissist insecure woman who project all her insecurities onto me and on top of that I constantly got told by her that if someone sees the „real me“ they would run away from me and never like or befriend me, and so I started to believe it. But like I said I had built good friendships but I never opened up about my trauma my struggles to my friends or anyone, my parents are toxic, my siblings are too young to understand and the only people I can basically relay on are my friends but there is so much shame and guilt that I can’t open up easily. And I don’t want to be that person who constantly relays on someone because of my mental illness. I always longed for someone to see the real me the true me and accept it, I always wanted someone to accept me for who I am to be there for me to be my safe space. That longing was a mother wound in combination with severe loneliness due to mental disorders and shame. 

I never had real deep connection to anyone my mother failed me our relationship was surface level, she never was a real mother to me, and with my friends I nearly allowed any of them „in“ and showed vulnerability. Because of that I felt through out my whole life so lonely even now I am lonely I have to living parents, siblings, friends but also no one to relay on. I wish I could open up and that’s my goal inhale good friends that were trying to be there for me and I want to work on that to show vulnerability and form deeper connection with them. I also constantly am jealous of my friends and people around me because they have good mothers who they can relay on who they can go to and talk with even about the most insignificant thing and it hurts to see everyone having good daughter-mother relationship it breaks my heart I want to cry every time, I am happy for them too and don’t wish them anything bad or something like that but when you are in my place for this long with these traumas and battles it’s like people around you ram a kni*e in your heart without knowing it.People my age enjoyed their childhood, discovered many things about themselves, perused hobby’s interests, etc went out with friends lived life and their biggest worries are what am I gonna wear will my crush like that while I am for the whole of my childhood until my early twenties now trying to survive my day to day life barley alive and begging for little crumbs of love of people that are supposed to be your Anker in life.

Anxious

Just one of those days&#10;
When everything feels sideways


Lost in a maze of thoughts&#10;
Heart racing with no pause


Anxiously dreading about the tomorrow&#10;
Some fear and some sorrow


I believe I can ride this out &#10;
Just need to clear my head of this cloud


Constantly wishing for this feeling to pass &#10;
To gather the strength for this task


I close my eyes and take a deep breath &#10;
Take a step back from the edge


I will, as I always have in the past &#10;
Persevered through all the doubts cast


Just need to believe in the my strengths &#10;
Be ready to go to further lengths


Acknowledge the challenges, ahead they lie &#10;
Don’t overthink it I say but then I take deep sigh


A tingle through the body, A tremble in the hand &#10;
A sadness takes over like I’m sinking in the sand


Engulfed by emotions and everything around &#10;
All I can hear now is my heart’s pound


Unable to move, my body freezes &#10;
A sharp sound, a certain heaviness unleashes


I try to find a way to slow this rush &#10;
I remind myself I’m just anxious

mentalhealth,1ieabld,What does it mean when I stop taking SSRIs and there's no effect?,"I've been on Zoloft for 5+ years (unsure how long exactly) and basically ever since I started taking it I've wondered if it really had much of an effect on me. Last year I finally decided it was time to stop taking it, and my psych and I have been tapering me off of the medication over the course of several months and I've seen no changes. I've always found it difficult to gague my own mental state, and that's been made harder by the fact that I'm in somewhat of a pickle due to my life situation at the moment, but I feel that, all things considered, I'm handling things relatively fine. My depression and anxiety are still very much present and very much hindering my life, but no more or less so than before.

I haven't completely tapered off of them yet, but I've gone from a dose of 200mg to only 50mg at the moment. Not a single noticeable effect. And if there's no effect from stopping it, wouldn't that mean there wasn't much of an effect from being on it either?

Honestly, it's surreal and demoralizing to think that the past several years of my medication history might have been doing absolutely nothing for my mental health, and it feels frustrating to try to figure out where to go from here. I wish there were a way to just test your brain chemistry to see what medications would work. Does this mean I may have SSRI resistance?

mentalhealth,1ie95g7,I had my first psychotic break since my traumatic LSD trip 8 years ago,"I (23M) last night had a full psychotic breakdown for an acid trip I had when I was 15. For context, I was raised in religious cult behavior and was always pushed as a child to talk about death and the afterlife. Throughout my childhood my father was always making me read philosophy and contemplate the meaning of life and mortality. When I was 15 he pushed me to take LSD and Dabs for the first time. I had later received a TBI and quite literally believed I was dead while passed out while my body was unconscious my brain was still tripping and took my to a really pained place where I thought I was dead, able to see the patterns of reincarnation, and suddenly the voice of my collective cells screaming the word “why” over and over again.

I later in life went to college, became an artist, and have been doing therapy for 4years now unpacking lots of other traumas and the head injury. However, last night something triggered for me that took me back to that place. I smoked some weed,nothing out of the ordinary, I’ve been smoking for about 3 years now. So I thought it was completely fine. About 20 minutes in I begin to think a lot about death, I think that I am regressing in time and falling backwards in evolution all the way to the Big Bang. I begin feeling like I can only adhere to my animal senses like I could feel my atoms being a part of the black holes gravity at the center of the universe and my whole body is just screaming “why” in pain. I had never thought I’d go back there again to the lsd trip. I was so afraid I was dying again, but I knew how to get out this time, physically however I was uncommunicative except for saying random words that didn’t make sense to my partner(23F) she calls an ambulance and they admitted me and gave me Valium to calm down. 

I have therapy tomorrow which will be good for me, and it’s only been just over 36 hours since the episode. I wanted to tell this story to know if anyone has ever heard of this before. I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd before, but this scared me so much because it felt almost like it “confirmed a truth of the universe” for me in the moment. I don’t think that’s how I truly feel, but it is keeping me up and I can’t stop hearing that voice in my head screaming why and I’m worried I’ve reopened something that snapped long ago but needs fixing again.",1,2025-01-31 08:00:11,4,1.0,PutInternational6238

mentalhealth,1ie8vpx,Whats wrong with me and cartoons,"I'm not sure where else to take this since I feel like if I post something like this on a subreddit for any cartoon I like, I'll get jumped. It's nothing serious but I just want to know if there's something wrong with me.

I get, almost unreasonably, upset whenever some mischaracterizes a fictional character that I like. It fills me with such an intense and bitter emotion, similar to anxiety and panic, and I'm not sure what to make of it.

For example, I've recently gotten back into Sonic the Hedgehog after the 3rd movie. I've been a fan of the source since I was around 8 years old (now 20). I grew up with a few of the shows, a few games, some comics and lots of fandom related stuff - shipping and fanfic and what not.

Recently, I've noticed a lot of people headcanoning Sonic as trans sexual for little to no reason. They always spring up some poor reasonings regarding his character design compared to the other hedgehog characters, but that's it. There's no reason to see him as trans other than to self project onto the character; which of course, is perfectly fine. My issue comes with the people who have these headcanons, how rude and insensitive they are to the older fans of the source who don't understand the modern audience and who don't appreciate seeing a beloved character changed in such a major way.

I know it doesn't really matter all that much, but it's still something that upsets me greatly because it makes no sense. Headcanons, although not canon, are suppose to stem from SOME sort of truth about the characters. Say for example... I can see Sonic having ADHD because he constantly needs to be moving, can't stay still and gets stressed when forced to slow down for any reason. That makes sense, right? It hasn't been confirmed that Sonic has ADHD, but it's a thing that would make sense if it were made to be canon.

Sonic is just a more recent example. I get this way toward other mischaracterizations as well and I don't know why I get so upset over it. It genuinely feels like a trigger. My heart will start racing and I'll get more shaky - I don't know if I just have some undiagnosed autism or something but it's an issue if had for a long time. Even when I was younger, simpler things, like people not getting the lyrics to a song correctly. I'd get upset and correct them, leading to them not liking me.

I don't know, just something thats been on my mind. Not sure what I'm expecting to get by posting this but eh.",1,2025-01-31 07:40:52,2,0.67,A-Mouse-

mentalhealth,1ie8g82,Coworker eats Graphite,"So as the title suggests, I have a coworker who eats the graphite out of pencils.

I tend to do a lot of closing duties at our restaurant and one of those duties is bathroom checks. I immediately started noticing chewed up pencils in the sanitary disposal units in the women’s bathroom stalls. 

These pencils are torn open and have had the graphite removed from them, I at first thought it was a stress thing but now I’m convinced she’s actually eating the graphite from inside the pencil. Slowly I deducted it was her after seeing her go to the bathroom for long periods of time and today I saw her enter the bathroom with a pencil in her back pocket and leave without it.

The problem is I’m not particularly close with her but ultimately I am worried. She’s a sweet very kind girl, I really just want to see if she’s doing ok but I’m not sure how to approach it.

Is it a problem that I should find a way to confront her about? As far as I know she’s been doing this for at least 2 months now. I don’t think anyone else has caught on to it besides myself and I certainly don’t want to embarrass her or confront her in a way that would feel belittling.

Anything you guys can think of would be phenomenal because I’m stuck, do I wait and see if she stops on her own? Do I anonymously reach out to her?

mentalhealth,1ie8cll,I feel like a bad partner,"I feel like a bad partner

Me and my partner have been together for a year now, we are long distance and in this one year they clearly struggled with their mental health from day to day, some days are better than the other and I just loved them through it all.

In our relationship they once had a very bad depressive episode, it lasted two weeks or maybe a little more and they slowly spiraled in front of my eyes and I really couldn’t help with anything because we were less than 6 months in and I never dated someone who struggled with depression.

In the end they ghosted me for a couple days, but then slowly came back and went back to normal, they cleaned their room and went out and we had deep talks about that period and what we both felt but couldn’t communicate back then, it was such an important period in our relationship because it made us trust each other more and learn new ways to love each other.

I used to think that if this ever happens again, I’ll be ready, I will know what to do or say and I’ll be able to support my partner the right way.

Well it is happening again right now and I feel just as lost, it started small with a small argument then our schedules didn’t match for a minute and I started noticing the signs, they’re constantly feeling lost, no positive look on the future, a lot of suicide jokes that don’t sound like jokes, asking for more alone time, having hard time with sleep, anxious about everything and nothing and a lot more.

At first I tried implementing what I know, gave them their space and kept reminding them I love them, it felt like they started floating away from me, we don’t have talks or laughs anymore, I barely know what they’re doing or what happened today at work or how’s the dogs doing, just surface level stuff.

I tried communicating that I miss them, want to spend more time together, tried to work on my schedule to get more free time to spend with them, it just doesn’t feel the same, and it makes me anxious to be around the person I love and feel awkward and stressed.

The last couple of days every chance we got to talk it’ll end up turning to basically me crying about how much I miss them and asking them to tell me what’s wrong or what do they need help with and them telling me they don’t know and apologizing.

I know what I’m doing is not right but I don’t know what else to do, today I tried giving them some tough love I guess by pointing out that something they said is something they said last time before spiraling completely and told them that they really need to break the cycle before it gets worse and that I love and care about them and don’t want it to get worse for them.

I don’t know if what I’m doing is right, I don’t even know what would be right, I don’t like talking to people irl about this because I feel like my partner’s mental health is our business and don’t want them to view my partner as a sick person, so I’m turning to Reddit for advice.

mentalhealth,1ie3q2l,Are these intrusive thoughts?,"Sorry if this is written badly but I want some outside perspective.
Ok so for the past year-ish, I've dealt with strange thoughts. I'm not exactly sure where they came from, anymore, but I know that after getting kinda fucked over because of issues with my (now ex) friends I've been thinking of killing people (real people, that is. I feel like I should specify that because I've written about having violent thoughts in the past and I vaguely remember it, but I'm still not sure so I just specify that's when I started thinking about killing real people, if that makes sense).
My head was a bit messed up during the time right after my falling out with my friends so I didn't really question wanting to kill them in the past (it's hard to explain). Now I've been doing more introspection in an attempt to try and get my life back on track, though, I've started to wonder what exactly those thoughts are, and I feel like I should get some hopefully unbiased, new perspectives on it.
Anyway, while I was reading a bit on those thoughts I've come across two ways which people usually categorize them: homicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts. Frankly, I don't even know if they're serious enough to be considered either, but they've come back recently and have gotten worse because one of those ex friends recently contacted me again, so I'm kinda desperate for answers (and help, maybe).
I don't know if this is too little or too much detail, but if anyone has any helpful advice I'd appreciate it. Feel free to ask me for more details, if it would be helpful, by the way.",2,2025-01-31 02:47:28,2,1.0,_absurdism

I'm thankfully doing a lot better now and 2024 was a great year for me, I've been pushing myself a lot to imrpove and take better care of myself but there's some things my parents say or do from time to time that make it harder for me but like I never said anything they have no idea it's even making me feel bad. I *know* I have to tell them anyway so it can be resolved but after so long of hiding it I just don't know how to even bring it up, let alone put it all together into something that makes sense.

She had a thigh gap and looked like the wore size XS clothes. I know it's rude to talk about people's weight but I think this is slightly deserved considering she just told everyone that if they're calling themselves skinny at that size, they're delusional. It just really annoyed me and I had to make a post about it because she looked like she could be a model on a runway, yet was making everyone beleive that was midsize. It's sad how shockingly brainwashed everyone is on social media to the point people are saying that being severely underweight is the healthiest. Something else rlly annoying is when people say ""nothing tastes better than being skinny""? Yes there is? Ever went to Prezzo? Omg it makes me so angry.

When will people stop promoting eating disorders?! I saw another video a while ago of a girl posing on the camera with a text that said ""my doctor just told me I'm severely underweight"" and she was acting as if that was a good thing and was showing off her body?! People on the comments were saying shit like ""she's just jealous"" or ""no you're just not a fatty"" WTF?! I can assure you she isn't jealous she is just doing her job and telling you that you need to eat more?!. 

Yk what also annoys me? When people who smoke, do drugs and eat only ice cubes say that they're healthier than a bigger person just because they're skinnier.

mentalhealth,1ie6j59,Smoking cigarettes and drinking coke,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was quite a young child. Doctors have always needed to be told what I thought was up with me, and for the longest time I just figured depression/anxiety/ocd/agoraphobia. I’ve recently learned that I have PTSD from my childhood, as well as from being savagely run over 4 1/2 years ago. Antidepressants have only helped to an extent, and the antipsychotics don’t seem to do much either. As of late, I’ve been looking into Autism and ADHD, thinking it may explain some of my struggles mentally (trust me, I am not that type to jump on the bandwagon, and it seems like everyone and their grandmothers are being diagnosed with these disorders (to be fair, this is mostly on the internet honestly, I don’t know a single person, myself, with these disorders, I have zero friends though lol so who knows.) but I’m feeling as if nobody will believe me, or write off my concerns as they typically do. I did find a new doctor recently, and I struggle to communicate everything that’s going on unfortunately, he is the first to take my debilitating stomach issues seriously though (these severe issues are caused by all of these mental issues) (I haven’t seen a psychiatrist in about 20 years probably, the wait here to get in to see somebody is over 18 months and getting the referral isn’t easy). Anyways, after that spiel, I was wondering (because I read autism could be caused by lack of oxygen in fetal development) if the fact that my mother admitted to doing nothing, during her pregnancy with me, other than chain smoking cigarettes and drinking coke all day, is potentially the reason I’ve struggled my entire life?  Also, I could definitely use some courage or advice to get this out to my doctor. My husband of 17 years is supportive to an extent but really cannot comprehend why I am the way I am and doesn’t believe I have reasons to be depressed or scared.

mentalhealth,1ie62dn,Being Devoid of Human Interaction Has Made Me Seem Rude,"I've never had anyone truly understand me or care about me my whole life. I hate talking about my problems because I've never met anyone who could fully understand, so it feels pointless. I grew up having to deal with things on my own, just moving on without support. In some ways, it's made me stronger, but I know it's also damaged a part of me.
Not having even one person genuinely care about me or my feelings has made any form of affection, any sense of being ""cared for"", feel strange. When I meet new people, they sometimes try to hug me, but I just don’t hug back. Afterward, I get questioned about it, sometimes even called rude. It’s never intentional, and I only realize later that it might come across that way. I’m just not used to being noticed, hugged, or cared for. The concept feels foreign to me, and to be honest, it makes me uncomfortable.
Maybe it’s because I’ve always associated affection with weakness, I don’t know. I just wish I wasn’t like this. 
I just don't feel comfortable with anybody who isn't exactly like me, that could explain why I have 0 friends, and it also may explain why I prefer being completely alone than having friends who aren't like me. I've ruined so many potential friendships because of this, but I just can't do friendships like that. I complain that I'm alone yet it seems like I always resort to isolating myself it's not my fault I'm never genuinely understood.

mentalhealth,1ie5w48,Anxious about being anxious??,"Does anyone get anxious about being anxious?

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my young adult life but it really came to a head around 5 years ago. Since then, I have been on medication and done therapy and feel like I've come to a good position when it comes to coping. 

Recently though, I had a dip in my mental health and had to go back on medication - the side effects have been brutal and I'm only just getting back to feeling normal. I live alone and don't have anyone to help me out if I struggle with basic tasks, so survival is key. 

One think I've noticed I do whenever I go through a very difficult time is that I remember everything very vividly and I mentally keep notes of dates/anniversaries of these hard times. I'm actually not great at remembering dates usually, but its like my mind can't help but get triggered by reminders of those times. 

For example - I know the exact dates and series of events from when I had my first big panic attacks. I remember the specific thoughts I had when adjusting to the medication back in 2020. I remember the physical symptoms I've suffered with before. 

Recently, I've been adjusting to a medication I've taken before, but I can't help but wake up and instantly scan my body for any physical symptoms of anxiety. I had a lot of panic and anxiety last week from the side effects and now I feel like I'm on high alert for any signs of it coming back throughout my day.

Is this common? Is there a name for this? 

  
tldr; being triggered by my own mental health struggles like they're anniversaries - is it common? does it have a specific name?",1,2025-01-31 04:39:11,0,1.0,heregoesro

In my recent dream, I woke up in bed and wanted to get up, but I couldn’t move. There was this strange presence that I’ve seen in my nightmares before. I don’t really know what it is, but it always scares me. (Recently feeling like shi*, feeling like there’s something watching me all the time)

As I tried hard to get up, I felt completely helpless. This entity seemed to be keeping me down, and I felt like it was feeding off my fear. I started praying for help, feeling completely powerless against it.

Then, I decided to give in and promised myself that I wouldn’t get up, letting the entity stay on my bed. For a moment, I thought I had escaped it. But then I realized I still couldn’t move.

The being felt delicate and gentle, but it still wouldn’t let me stand up. I held its hands, which were really thin and fragile, but it had a strong grip on me. I asked it for help, hoping it might let me go.

Suddenly, I woke up, feeling both relieved and confused. The image of this fragile yet powerful being stuck with me, leaving me feeling uneasy.

mentalhealth,1ie5ap5,Feeling down and completely drained,"Emotionally, physically, and mentally, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. I got dumped, and it was my first relationship—I went into it not fully understanding what was acceptable and what wasn’t. Looking back, it was filled with emotional and mental abuse, and I didn’t even realize how much it was breaking me down until it was too late. Now, I feel drained, like she took everything out of me and left me empty.

Before this relationship, I was in the best shape of my life. I was strong, confident, and had a clear sense of who I was. But now, when I look in the mirror, I barely recognize myself. All I’m left with are emotional scars, a broken heart, and a chronic disc injury that has taken away the one thing I loved most—weightlifting.

Sometimes, I think about how different things would be if I had never been in that relationship. If I hadn’t ignored the red flags, if I hadn’t been helping her move furniture that day, maybe my back would still be fine. But I don’t want to sit here blaming her—the only person I can hold accountable is myself for overlooking the signs and staying when I should have walked away.

This whole situation has been weighing on me heavily, and mentally, it’s been really tough. I haven’t talked to anyone about it, but the truth is, I’ve been feeling so down. It’s like no matter how much time passes, the emotions still hit me hard. I keep replaying everything in my head—what happened, what I should have seen earlier, what I could have done differently.

I didn’t realize how much this relationship was taking from me while I was in it, but now that it’s over, I feel the full weight of it. It wasn’t just the breakup—it was the emotional and mental toll of everything leading up to it.

I've had it three counseling sessions including this one and I consider the previous two to go quite well.

It was only in retrospect that I had some concerns about my meeting today after letting my anxiety cool down from numerous other issues.

On the first day I went to see the psychiatrist I had received a phone call the day before from her Receptionist telling me  my appointment time.

I showed up 20 minutes before appointment time and was told that my appointment was at a different time and that I was late and that the psychiatrist would not see me.  

I told the receptionist that I would not leave until a supervisor Or the psychiatrist came to have some kind of a chat with me since it was an error on their end.  

The psychiatrist ended up deciding to see me anyway And our appointment actually went really well.

At the end of my appointment I saw my counselor in the hallway for the psychiatrist office and I said hello to him and he seemed friendly at the time.

Today one of whenever i showed up for my appointment the first thing he told me was to never be rude to the psychiatrist again or anyone inside of that office..

I was really confused and told him I had never been rude to anyone in that building and he told me it was from the day of my psychiatrist appointment..

The front staff apologize to me about the psychiatrist appointment and even sympathized with me but after being confronted and counseling it's all I can think about..

I'm trying to be reasonable maybe he got some wrong details from someone who overheard, maybe he just heard that there was an issue with me and assumed that I was highly disgruntled..

The more I think about going back the more distressed I've become..

I was thinking of attending my next two or three appointments and seeing how the vibe was but I'm afraid that that small confrontation will become some kind of barrier between us.

mentalhealth,1ie4azz,i had a strange occurence,"


Okay so a few weeks ago, i completely dissociated from my mind for about an hour and a half and i have no recollection of what happened. What i'm about to tell you is a combination of everything my mum and siblings have told me

i was pacing around the house touching every corner for about thirty minutes. Nobody could communicate with me. then i went to my room and it sounded like i was messing with random things but they couldn't for sure tell what. 

My mum comes into my room and asks me what the problem is and i don't say anything except for ""what?"" over and over

then my mum goes and talks to my siblings so she gets the full picture and she takes me out to the car n we go for a drive

according to my mum i am fidgeting with random things in the car such as vents, glove box handle, etc. She then asks me if i'm faking and i don't say anything. She decided to call my dad to try and get me to snap out of it but it didn't work. she decided she was going to take me to get something to eat and if that didn't work i was going to go to the hospital. she tries to ask me multiple times what i want to eat but i only say ""huh?"" and ""what?""

My mum decides to get me a burger and slush from sonic and as soon as I drank the slushie, i came back to normal.

The very last thing i can remember before this incident is leaving my mums room after talking with her about something. then i remember being in sonic parking lot.

i have no idea what this is, i have never in my life messed with drugs or smoking and i also have a very healthy diet. I am autistic/adhd so could that have something to do with it???

mentalhealth,1ie443m,Worst Physician Assistant/Psychiatrist Visit In History,"Hey ya'll.  Hope everyone's staying comfortable and looking forward to the weekend.

The topic of this post is an appointment I had today with a psychiatric physician's assistant (PA).  Now, I'm sure this PA is a nice guy.  But my appointment with him was probably the worst experience I have ever had in the mental health system.

I had never met him before (I haven't had a psych appointment in a long time, but decided to get one as I am going through a rough patch).  When he first came out to get me, I noticed that the guy was... icy.  He almost never looked me in the eye, betrayed no emotion in his voice, never smiled (or even frowned!).  He didn't want to make small talk with me on our way to the exam room - which was fine, I thought, since the clinic is a busy place and he probably had other things on his mind.  But then the exam started...

He immediately informed me, without a hint of (even feigned) sympathy, that my problems were not something a psychiatrist (or psych PA) could do anything about - what I needed was therapy.  I didn't question him on this point at first since I figured I could ask about it after the preliminary questions were out of the way.  He then told me that he was only responsible for adjusting my medications; any other psychiatric concern would have to be discussed with someone else.  Alright, fine.  He then asked some basic preliminary questions (""how old are you,"" ""have you ever seen a psychiatrist before,"" etc.) and, completely out of the blue, told me that I likely have a large number of cluster A personality disorder traits.  I was totally floored by that remark - I have seen plenty of mental health professionals in my life, and never before has the topic of a personality disorder, or even traits of a personality disorder, even arisen.

So I asked him whether he thinks that my cluster A personality traits are so extreme that I have a personality disorder.  He said that he is almost certain that I do.  Quite a confident remark given that he had just met me 20 minutes earlier and told me that he was only going to do medication adjustments!  Feeling a bit stunned, I asked him why he thinks I have a personality disorder.  He said that he has met a lot of people and has developed an ""intuition"" for personality disorders.  I asked him what specifically made him think that I had a personality disorder.  He reiterated that he has a lot of experience and has met a lot of people.  Not very satisfying.

I then told him that while I really don't want to hurt myself, I am afraid of becoming a burden on my family, and that I would rather not be alive than be a burden.  He said that I was rational enough to make ""that decision"" (his words) on my own.  No follow-up questions or expression of concern.

He made a single, minor adjustment to my medication, and basically told me the appointment was over (15 minutes early).  I didn't really want to talk to him anymore so I just left.

I want to reiterate that every time he talked to me, he had a totally icy, expressionless demeanor.  I realize not everyone has the compassion of Mr. Rogers, but he almost seemed to be treating me with contempt.

Has anyone else had an experience like this?  Is this appropriate behavior from a psych professional?  Because honestly, this appointment made me want to totally remove myself from the psychiatric system.",1,2025-01-31 03:05:14,8,1.0,I-Love-All-Of-You1

okay, first thing to note, I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what it is -- but I'll just be listing down everything cuz I'll burst and I need someone to help me, just talk or whatever :(

so, I don't wanna self-diagnose, but it's so apparent that I'm not very ""normal"", I've been very different compared to my peers. I've been indirectly bullied for not understanding jokes or I've been isolated just because I don't fit in at all. I feel like I have to force myself to fit in, laugh at their jokes, I just feel so boxed out when I'm with others. Like I keep up constant things just to fit in and I'm so fucking tired of doing that. I'm so tired to be the one watching, to not understand, and just feel like an outsider. 

my family even calls me weird or abnormal and it fucking hurts me so bad, because I know how weird I am compared to them. I don't act like my siblings, I'm a mess, I'm disorganized and a slob -- and I try to fix it but it doesn't work. Like I try to clean my space but my mind finds everything so overwhelmed just by the thought of that alone, like the steps and everything makes me not wanna do it all even when I want to, and it's a constant pattern. I wanna do smth but I'm just so paralyzed? That's why my family calls me lazy but I can't just explain that silly process of mine and I hate it, it causes me so much damn problems. Like with school, I always get the urge to do it last minute even when it's so quick and I've missed sm assignments. 

and the worst is when I get super sensitive and get all destructive because something overwhelms me, like my sister constantly saying things that makes me stressed out and   I get all panicky and tears and I get called emotional and I cant help when the feeling just takes over me? and I shun them out and get all mean and just act like a child, the countless times I've destroyed outings just because of that just makes me feel bad for my parents, why do they deal with me? 

I feel like an empty shell, I feel so fucking empty, I feel like I don't exist half of the damn time I'm so tired guys, I don't wanna exist anymore I don't wanna be different anymore I stress everyone esp my parents so much and I feel so bad for being this way and I don't even know why I'm like this? I don't wanna be like this and I've tried fixing myself but it never works

why was I born like this? why can't I be mormal, why do I always have to be thehard-headed girl and just not be a burden, I can't anymore

mentalhealth,1idxmsr,Who else struggles with processing their emotions because they end up feeling corny & how do you deal with it?,"I struggle with my mental health a lot and on top of that I’ve had some shitty life events over the last couple of months and I’m suffering inside but It’s so hard for me to talk about any of it in a serious setting or process my emotions because I end up feeling incredibly corny/cringe.
I have no idea why this happens. I don’t find it corny or cringe when other people struggle with their mental health, it’s more of a ‘me’ thing I suppose. It sucks and it’s preventing me from actually feeling my emotions thus causing me to push them down and sorta file them away in my brain. 
It’s also the same with conflicts. If I accidentally hurt someone and they tell me I do genuinely try to communicate and work through it but I still get all awkward and anxious, it’s actually infuriating. 
Does anyone else struggle with this? If so any advice? Ts sucks 😭

I looked at myself in the mirror but I didn't recognise me. It was really surreal, like I was looking at someone else. I'm not normally someone who cares about how they look but for the first time I just really didn't like my face. I looked sort of lifeless. I looked myself in the eyes and it's really freaked me out. It was like someone else was looking back at me. 

I feel like I'm spiralling. I have good friends, parents and teachers but none of them know how bad I'm struggling. I don't really know what to do, I don't feel comfortable telling anyone. ",2,2025-01-30 22:03:12,0,1.0,gandalf_Kenobi

I’ve cut myself out of most of these friendships. And when I did that, all of them never reached out. It shows that all along, I’ve been the only one to put in the effort.

mentalhealth,1idwgwu,Struggling in this new chapter of life.,"I will try and keep this as short as possible. I’m 36M, married for the last year with a newborn and 11 year old. 

Since I’ve been with my wife I’ve learned so much about myself and the lack of support I’ve had my entire life from my family. 

Since ive been on this journey, I almost feel it’s made things worse for me. The people I thought I could count on now feel like the enemy to me. 

I now see that I can’t trust them, there’s jealousy amongst my siblings, favoritism from my parents with my other siblings and I always feel like they like me struggling, because it almost makes them feel better about themselves. 

My mom has always been the person who dismisses my feelings, lectures me on how I should be better and then ends up talking about herself or telling me to take it to god. 

My dad always makes a joke of things and has honestly been pretty horrible most of my life, but it’s gotten a little better as he’s aged. Mostly because I’m doing well financially and have my shit together. At least that’s my thoughts. 

The hard/ confusing part is that my parents aren’t bad people. They’re honestly pretty good most of the time, but they’ve just never been there for me. They each dismiss me in their own way. 

It’s making me have deep resentment towards them, which makes me feel depressed/ withdrawn and it’s impacted my friendships (those have dwindled to almost nothing), my happiness, my relationship with my wife, etc.. 

I’ve always struggled with never feeling important enough, feeling like I never fit in (even though I’m pretty outgoing and have always had a lot of different friend groups my whole life) and just extremely self conscious of myself. To the point that I often uproot myself in the search for something new and exciting where people don’t know the real me. Once I feel exposed, I often want to run away or I really distance myself. 

This uneasy feeling inside my own body has led me to alcohol abuse over the years and this need to escape my own life. I’ve struggled with that feeling since I’ve been 16/17. This greatly impacts many important areas of my life. 

I’m really struggling with myself as I’m getting older and entering into this new chapter of being married and starting over with another kid. 

I feel stuck in my job, because I need to provide and feel miserable most days. I do my best to put on a smile, but some days I can’t hide it. This constant feeling of not fitting in with others, feeling like an imposter at my job, and my deep hate for myself and now my family is honestly too much for me to handle. 

Theo Von said it best “it’s not that I haven’t had anyone, it’s that nobody has had me.” I really feel like my wife is the only person I have and that also comes with rules/ guidelines. The second she doesn’t feel safe/ stable financially, that goes out the window. 

There’s so many more details in there, but I’m struggling to put this together and have it make sense. 

Has anyone else felt like this and overcome it? Any thoughts or support you have is greatly appreciated. I know I should probably do therapy, but I just don’t know how they can help me. It almost feels like this will never go away.. 

I can’t drink like I used to, smoking weed makes me withdraw even more and makes me more depressed, and I just kind of feel like I’m exposed to myself and I don’t know how to handle me own thoughts and emotions. ",2,2025-01-30 21:21:12,0,1.0,OkMarket1210

Then I started gradually feeling better and better each day but recently, past week I have been getting this brain pain that is hard to describe but its not pressure and its not like a normal headache or migraine. The best way I can explain it is, it's like an actually painful, exhausted, tingly fear feeling in the back and top of my head and also my neck. It makes thinking hard and also thinking about something worsens the pain. It is pretty much consistently the same intensity level.

tw: eating disorders

i (17f) have been having moments of clarity? sort of? i don’t know what to call them but i have been having these moments of wanting to put my life back on track , i am an avid self sabotage-r, i suffer with diagnosed anorexia, depression and anxiety, and anxiety related disorders. i have a boyfriend (17m) of just over 1 year now, a loving supporting family, and am on medication for my disorders.

like today, me and my boyfriend just had a “play fight” he was tickling me, please don’t take this in a weird way but, “threatening” to spit in my bellybutton (it’s just how we play)

in response to him moving closer to my stomach, i grabbed his hair, then shortly after he grabbed mine, it was all fine until after, i apparently “pulled out a chunk of his hair”, i don’t think i did and if i did, i genuinely didn’t mean to. then i got all catty and started giving attitude, he also started doing the same.

i feel like such a twat , this isn’t the first time i’ve just had attitude for no reason, i think it’s because im scared of abandonment, so when im scared / or done something wrong i’ll try and ruin something before it ruins me.

it’s driven me into another depressive episode, and im starting to subconsciously starve myself again, i keep ruining peoples moods and it shatters me.

but here we are, ive tried and tried to sort my “ways” out but im always so full of anger, pity or sadness (not to sound emo). i want to better myself. but i genuinely cant figure out how. 

any advice?

i’ve tried consistently taking my meds but i cant swallow tablets properly so its hard, and they dont do much, 

therapy; im waiting to see a psychiatrist but ive been waiting a 2 years with no updates, 

ive also been in CAMHS but they discharged me because “they couldn’t help me” (they never actually tried) 

i fear speaking to my family about it because 1. it burdens them, and 2. it’s just the “take your meds” conversation then it turns ugly :/ 

ive also tried a bunch of “minor” things, like keeping a decent routine, but it’s hard since i literally don’t do anything (e.g. go out with friends) 

i can’t keep living like this and being miserable with myself, and making other people miserable, i want to get better. my meds are a last resort, i don’t want to rely on them. i want to be a better person. ",1,2025-01-30 23:31:41,0,1.0,followmy0nlyfans

I’ve been in a state of serious burnout because of work for the last year.

It is definitely a long road — between perimenopause, trial and error with meds, and just general brain-spiciness, I feel like I have made zero progress.

I take 150mg Venlafaxin in the morning and 50mg of Amitriptyline in the evening before I sleep.

Almost 3 years ago I was barely 55kg and then gained 10kg in one year while on Fluvoxamine and now I'm here.

mentalhealth,1idwvk1,My thoughts nearly once every day feel like they scream with pure anger at me…,I don’t know what happens. It comes out of no where. And when it happens my understanding of tone goes out the window. Anything I think or hear sounds rage filled and like it’s all just trying to cause a fight with myself or anything I listen too. I have songs I usually go to for being overwhelmed but this is new. I don’t know what this is. I go to the songs and even they sound like they are angry at me. For reference the main song I go to is “weight of the world” by citizen soldier. I can think what I want when this happens. But no matter what it’s screaming in my head. I don’t know what’s happening when it does happen. The songs didn’t help cause they sounded angry to me in the moment and I didn’t wanna ruin them. So I turned them off. Then tried my favorite show. They sounded angry too… so I put on a video of a 417 hz sound. I’m listening to it right now. It’s the only thing plus time and waiting that got rid of it. Is this an anxiety attack or depression or what? I’ve been dealing with a lot of very strong emotions recently and my mental health has taken a dive.

mentalhealth,1idwn7f,"Seeing a psychiatrist in Ontario, Canada experiences?","I am 7 months pregnant and struggle with severe anxiety, especially health anxiety. As you can imagine, this has made pregnancy extremely difficult due to all the appointments and tests. I especially have a fear around getting my blood pressure measured. The fear is so big that I have anxiety and panic attacks for weeks before appointments if I know they could measure my blood pressure. 

My BP is all over the place when it’s measured (usually with one of those automatic readers). 

I am seeing a midwife as the care they provide is better for someone with anxiety. They are extremely supportive, calming and kind. My blood pressure has been in the normal range with them and they take it on one of those manual cuffs.

However, they know I still struggle a ton with health anxiety and getting my blood pressure measured. So they referred me to a perinatal psychiatrist to help me with coping strategies or maybe even to prescribe something to take before appointments. But I have an appointment with one next week and I am terrified. 

The part I am most terrified about is if they will require to take my BP. I know I have the right to refuse and they can’t legally force me. But will he refuse to see me because I won’t let them take my blood pressure? Again, this causes me immense anxiety and could lead to a terrible spiral lasting weeks or months. I get it taken at my prenatal appointments but that’s it. The reason I am seeing him is to talk about management around my blood pressure phobia and health anxiety.

mentalhealth,1idhi2c,I’m on the brink of losing everyone because of what I’m doing 👎🏼🧒🏼,"I was drawing a picture of a person (me), being left alone and the other people (my boyfriend and friends) leaving me. I also drew a tall person (that skank who I used to see as my big brother and soulmate) being followed by my boyfriend and friends while leaving me and I have no one, but myself to rely on. The drawing made me extremely sad and I feel like people are lying to me when they say “I’m here for you”, “I’ll never leave you” and all that… I’m having a hard time believing them, but I just say “Ok” and add a heart emoji on the person’s message. I am so tired of feeling this way and hearing all these words… It’s not working… 🧒🏼💔

I can’t tell everyone that I cut myself again because I know they will be so upset and angry at me and say “Why did you lie?”, “I’m never speaking to you anymore”, “…” and then just block me and pretend that I don’t exist. I know I have to be honest, but when it comes to self harm, NO FRICKEN WAY. =(

I just want someone to talk about my struggles to and listen to me without feeling tired of me constantly being sad and all that like how I listen to that skank when he needed someone to listen to him, but after I vented to someone, they would always say “don’t worry”, “everything will be ok”, “stay strong” and all that and I hate it so much… Last night, I wanted to post a story that said  “I don’t want to hurt you guys mentally, but I hate all of you. You always say don’t worry, I’m here for you, you’re not alone and all that stuff”, but it sounded so harsh, so I didn’t post it. 

I’m now on the brink of losing everyone I know… and if I talk to anyone else online about my struggles, they will all say “forget them” or something. 🧒🏼💔

mentalhealth,1idplqr,Carastriphizing and anxiety because of my alcoholic mother,"Hey. I’m 32M. I’ve been living with my grandma since I was a little kid. My mom was living in different countries throughout my whole life. My grandma is 82 years old and I moved out a year ago with my fiancé because of some mental stuff she was going through such as accusing my fiancé of stealing etc etc (typical dementia stuff). She is much better now because she’s taking pills. I’ve been visiting her every day since I moved out. Sometimes twice a day.

Now about my mom. I visited her couple times in different countries but it was always so stressful. She has problems with depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol. Plus she has 2 daughters (my half sisters) that also give her hell. There was always some problems in her life that I didn’t wanna be apart of, but sometimes was forced to. She recently decided to come back here because after all these years in different country he says she has nothing, has some debts and needs a new start. I’m okay with that as she said she will help with taking care of grandma. 
She’s been like 3 weeks here and was already wasted twice. Once to a point I had to stay all night at the house because I felt like I had to protect my grandma. When my mom doesn’t drink she does A LOT around the house. Really, she cleans, cooks, goes shopping etc. 

Here’s the thing. I once managed to win over the anxiety once she was abroad but now she came back and my anxiety is through the roof. I keep thinking something’s wrong or she’ll get drunk. I keep feeling like I have to raise her and my grandma, I project what kind of feelings they might have, put them on myself and just feel so overwhelmed. It’s like I’m living their life instead of my own.
I keep waiting for a phone call that something’s wrong. My heart is about to blow out of my chest ever day very evening. I was at the house there today and I felt like the vibe was tough. Turns out my mom and her mom (my grandma) got into a little fight and I’m scared it’s gonna turn into my mom getting drunk and yelling and screaming. I keep imagining those scenarios. 
In all this mess, I think I’m too attached to my grandma. I keep imagining herself vaulnerable, sad and regretful etc. I keep seeing it in my head even tho both of them say I shouldn’t be nervous and not to think about it and don’t worry because it’s gonna be good. But it’s just talking. I’m so done. I am so… so tired. Mentally and physically. It’s like having kids and being on alert 24/7 putting myself in a hero position where I have to work everything out for them.
My grandma has 2 more kids, my aunt and my uncle and I don’t understand how they are just not as involved in all this. It’s like they can’t feel what they feel or something. 

I don’t think I can go any longer without some pills. I just don’t know how to stop living their life and trying to fix their problems themselves. How to stop trying to control the situation all the time and having my happiness being depended on their happiness. Please help. ",2,2025-01-30 16:34:16,0,1.0,liverherjohnny

I am a 25F and for as long as I can remember I’ve been profoundly affected by reading/hearing about tragedies - particularly mass tragedies - even those that do not impact me or anyone I know. You might be thinking, ""yeah, everyone is because they are sad,"" but I feel like my response is outside the norm. As in I will sob for hours, lose sleep, and I mentally and physically feel grief. Even if it isn't something that just happened in the news, like a historical event, I will be immediately and profoundly impacted for usually several days after learning of it. My friends seem to say ""oh that is sad"" when they see news and then move on. It's gotten to the point that I sometimes feel like skipping class/calling off work (I am a PhD student), though it feels silly to. It FEELS like these things have happened to me/someone very close to me, even though I realistically know they haven't. It's not even so much that I am scared or worried they will happen to me.

I have tried to talk to a school counselor and people I know about this and they seem to attribute it to the fact that when I was in high school I sadly experienced a school massacre. That seems like an obvious answer, and while that was DEFINITELY traumatic when I am going through my grief over these events I don't really think about my own experience. As in it doesn't feel like a true trigger. And I had this response before that happened too.

I have been to therapy and I’m very aware of the deep causes of my anxieties and fears and know where most if not all of them stem from. Ultimately at point in my childhood I adopted the belief of not being enough. 

I’m a believer that our brains are very powerful and I don’t have to feel like this forever. 

Every person / therapist I speak to just teaches me techniques of ‘coping’ or ‘living’ with anxious thoughts and feelings and just learning  how to not attach to them. I believe this is a very important tool and I need to be able to do this but what I really need is to actually do practical exercises daily to train myself into deeper believing I am good enough and having high self esteem. I know this won’t happen overnight but I want to put the work in now. 

Has anyone got real successful advice on some techniques I can do to achieve this?

I literally couldn't imagine that. here's my theory: what if the reason I don't know what to do about my future now and I feel so lost is because I grew up focusing all my energy into surviving every day? I've spent the majority of my life in full alert mode, always stressed and anxious and fearful. my house wasn't the safest growing up and I've met some awful people that made the outside world also scary. that's why my mind is used to thinking day to day, I couldn't think of a future bc my mind was on survival mode and getting through the day was more important than making a plan for a future I wasn't really sure would happen. now I'm trying to figure out how to get out of that, bc I managed to make my own peaceful life. I moved out of my mom's house, I'm living with my dad where is actually safe and I don't have to worry abt anything and I'm trying to start being an adult. but I still can't seem to make a plan for my future and instead I'm freaking out bc I'm not used to things being so calm, sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for things to get shitty again. so yeah, hope I explained myself right and I'm sure someone else came to this conclusion before lol but still I wanted to share in case it can help someone",2,2025-01-30 15:53:05,0,1.0,igbt505

mentalhealth,1idtkec,Help me! :( I don´t know what to do with my life as a medical resident?,"I´m a 27 yo male medical resident (internal medicine) in Germany and I absolutely hate my job. It´s way too stressful and the responsibility is overwhelming. I want to quit. But I have invested so much in this career path already. I am passionate about philosophy, biology, astronomy but instead of studying philosophy, I chose medicine because it seemed like a safe option and I wanted to be financially secure. I also suck at maths lol

So I called in sick for 2 weeks and I´m probably about to be fired next monday. I don´t know where to go and what to do.

I also have Crohn´s and am fatigued a lot of times and I also struggle with anxiety and depression. I have been in therapy for the last 2 years but I only have 5 more sessions left...

I live with my parents and have no debt.

I´m not really interested in medicine at all. I thought I could become a family medicine doctor because I like the idea of being self employed but I would have to go through over 2 more years of training in a hospital. I have only worked for 9 months but I´m completely burned out already. I have to work for 24 hour shifts with very little rest twice a month. I am so scared of making a crucial mistake due to exhaustion that I can´t do another 24 hours shift.

There are no jobs for residents that are compatible with my fatigue and crohn´s",1,2025-01-30 19:20:46,11,1.0,kratos97asdf
mentalhealth,1idtdc4,Emotions & feelings after a hurtful; Painful transition mainly caused by loss of something you valued or other acute stresses in life,"Life is cyclical. Some days you have all the happiness and somedays out of no where, you find yourself ushered into the school of knock down unwillingly. This comes mostly after a ""Loss"". For instance loss of a relationship through separation, divorce or death, loss of a job and thus loss of a way to keep up with bills, loss of health after a certain diagnosis that kicks the balance out of your hands, loss of ability to conceive a baby, loss of ability to create a relationship or maintain one among others, and for the most part ""Hopelessness"". The most important thing here is how to handle the stress that is accompanied by this issues. Most importantly ""do not bottle up those emotions and feelings! speak out to someone you trust!

I lost my job when I was at a point where I needed it most. My World crashed before me all of a sudden and being the bread winner to a family of 4 with bills streaming in, it was a huge shock. ""How did I get here?"" was my biggest question but I quickly realized that was going to force me to capitalize on the past, get me into anger, frustration and status quo. So what worked out for me so that I am back on my feet again today;

1). I did not bottle up my feelings and emotions. I reached out to my ride or die friends for some conversation and comfort.

2). I reached out to my higher Power and my spiritual connection kept me in tune

3). I had to create some awareness meaning; it has happened, this job is over, so what next because sitting here lamenting or wishing will not help the situation

4). Getting ""unstuck"" was not an option but key

5). Walking in forgiveness not for them but for me was a major thing

6). I had gratitude even in the waiting

Being a mental health practitioner did not exempt me from passing through this painful process. I have realized that navigating this territory well, getting the right help can help mitigate many individuals from landing into mental illness.

Before a person gets into Depression and Anxiety, there is a window period and a condition called ""Adjustment Disorder"". The support system you get, your actions in this season plus a few other pointers can help you sail through the lifechanging loss and transition into greatness where you thrive again. Calling out on anyone who is experiencing this terrain at this moment, do not stop at that, don't bottle up, speak to someone! I must say the shift worked for me and not against me and today I am an evangelist and a crusader advising everyone to speak out to someone in time. I know one of the symptom is hopelessness and isolation but please come out, go seek that help. Prevention is better than cure. Adjustment Disorder is reversible but Depression and Anxiety though treatable can linger for a while, and indeed affect other body organs because the body records the scores. We can do this.

Two questions come in mind, do I act or do I procrastinate? Love yourself and act early. # Mental health prevention",1,2025-01-30 19:12:35,0,1.0,Tough-Claim-2642

Sometimes i just think my life is too hard. I try my absolute best to the point im stressing myself just for no result. My friends are always mad at me and parents always disappointed. Sometimes it feels easier ans better to just no longer exists.
Like it would be easier to just die, but i cant tell anyone because since i haven't cut and dont have any cuts or bruises people think i want attention.
Which i do but not for the reason everyone thinks. I was help. Thats the attention i want, just for someone to take me seriously and help me 
Because im just sixteen i don't think im supposed to consider life hard yet. But everyday just feels like im drowning.
So much happens at once and its hard. And no one seems to believe me. No one takes me seriously no matter what i do or say I'm just treated like a spoilt kid by everyone.
Things are genuinely hard but since it's mostly school stuff and just my head space which i cant explain to people they think im being dramatic and start comparing. 
It hurts so much that not even my parents take me seriously when i say i want to die and just act like im being dramatic.

I’m at college now and I still haven’t gotten over my anxiety with people. I literally can’t even ask for questions to my teachers after class because I’m so scared. Whether it’s this one girl in my class that I really wish I could ask out, or the people I play basketball with, if I don’t already know them or they talked to me first, I cannot say anything or even look at anyone for more than a few seconds.

mentalhealth,1idswb8,I've had a realisation that I yet can't accept,"All my life I've heard people saying they hate themselves and all..
And whenever I've heard as such. I couldn't really understand. Because how do you even hate your self? I mean you stay with yourself 24/7 since you were born. I always wondered how self hatred looked like.

Until I realised several aspects of myself. I always said confidently that I could never hate my self. Yet ever since I could remember I would look at the mirror and think things like why couldn't have bigger eyes, fairer skin. I would blame myself for each bad grade, each mistake

Even now, Every bad grade I have a mental breakdown. Every photo makes me feel like and ogre and I avoid looking at mirrors. I can't help but look at my face and think what I could've changed. Every color makes me think that it's not for me. Every chance I get I try to prove myself I am better. I cringe at every thing I do and overthink every action afraid of what others think. I always hide my emotions for others just so THEY don't dislike me. I have this sense that everyone needs to like me, no matter I have to do in order for that. I hate how I actually different with everyone just to fit their taste.

Yet I am the biggest preacher of self love, I actually act like I don't care what others say. And I really used to think this was true. Until I realised, I was just a hypocrite as well. Who just didn't know..what  self hatred was..heck I can't even look at baby picture of my self without being disappointed.
My parents sibling all are gorgeous or have something they are good at.
I mean, I am not bad at anything tbh. But compared to others, I am just average. And I can't help that I wish I'd rather be amazing at just one goddamn is that too much to ask?

I hate that I've always hated myself even as a kid. And I hate that before today I've never had the courage to admit it. I hate how I have to prove myself everywhere. I hate how I have to undervalue my feelings to feel loved by others. I hate how I am scared to look people in the eyes everytime I honestly express myself. I hate skin, my eyes, my hair, my body,my marks, my grades. I hate it.
I hate my hypocrisy. I hate this false joyful facade I hold each day while I crumble inside.

mentalhealth,1idnhek,I feel caged. I’m isolated and no one understands how much pain I encounter just with my thoughts alone.,"I was enrolled in a college to pursue my passion in something I love. In there I met my boyfriend. I finished the first year, but in the summer, things took a turn for the worst. Something bad happened and my family completely banished me from my past life now. I was forced to withdraw even though I didn’t want to. I’m currently isolated from the friends I made. My boyfriend. And the passion that made me wake up early every morning. My family wants me to get a job, work and move on like my past never existed. Thing is… I simply can’t. My mind is stuck in the past, and in the “what could’ve been”. Everyday I struggle with my mental health. I tried to get jobs, but rejected multiple times. I go to the gym, but it’s not enough for me to get my energy out. I am not allowed to take dance classes as of now, and gym does not give me the happiness as much as dance did. I am even scared to ask my family if I can at least make new friends (I’m a social person, and being completely alone and isolated is making me go to the brink of my own demise). I lost the opportunity, I lost the people i love, I lost myself. I can’t go back because my family won’t let me. And what hurts the most is I already feel my boyfriend drifting away. Even though he told me he is working on himself to get better so he could fight for me. But the distance is not helping us. It’s making things worse. And I do not know if my family will accept him someday. And I know how much that college can really take up his time and energy, because I was there and I understand how it’s mentally, physically time consuming. 
I am envious of the people who are still there. I feel deep jealousy of the people who are free, and get to spend time with their loved ones ( friends and spouses). Who are taking dance classes, who have a space with a community of dancers to perform. 
I can’t even afford a therapist to talk to, and my family won’t allow it either for sure. 
My family has a weird power dynamic, and I simply have no power or control to make my own Decisions. I’m afraid of one particular family member because they manipulate others. They mock me in a joking manner which offends me, and the idea that this person might live with us, is daunting me. I need to get away. I need to leave. 
I can’t communicate my needs or emotions to my family because I’m afraid they will become stricter and control me more than they do. Maybe even take my electronics. And actually make me become insane. Also, I’m afraid and shameful to ask for my needs because I feel I don’t deserve to ask for it. Yet if I don’t, I won’t survive. 
Only way I can think of to communicate my needs is a mediator. But that definitely needs payment too. 
I’m stuck. I wish I could fix the past to prevent this, but I can’t. Everyday became the same. I just waste my time online. Barely doing anything because I am restricted. I am caged. I can’t escape. I had dreams, and all my coaches told me I have so much potential. That I was gonna “sky rocket” if I put my head in the hard work. But now it’s all gone. And the what could’ve been is haunting me. I dream about the college when I sleep from time to time. That’s the extent of how much it’s on my mind everyday. 
I’m currently grieving my past. Who I was. The people I love. And my dreams.",2,2025-01-30 14:55:37,0,1.0,Tough_Pea_1511
mentalhealth,1idne2y,DAE feel really uncomfortable showing happiness infront of friend and family?,"So in 30 (M) and I’m a really comfortable confident person, when it comes to work and social gatherings etc - I can talk for England and I’ve not got any insecurities with my appearance - I don’t get nervous and I can tackle things head on and speak to anyone 

That being said I grew up in a Pakistani household where if I had an opposing opinion to an elder, it’s the only time I would fold and “just listen to them” - also to note I am mixed raced with English, so it’s always felt mad conflicting to me, as dad left when I was 1 and step dad became dad who is also Pakistani- so I was raised in that regard 

Which I guess created a lot of suppression, I don’t hate my family, but I can defo see this having an effect on me, even though I’m just realising it now 

The feeling I associate the most with the above it’s being told my opinion is stupid and not correct /Pakistani culture is “even if you’re family are wrong - you must listen”

As I’ve got older and I understand myself very well now - I do have a few questions that keep playing in my mind and these are 

Although I’m mega outgoing I am an ambivert and I much prefer not too if I don’t have too, as ultimately is very draining. 

Q1 - When I’m infront of my partner or my family, if someone tells a joke for a second and I begin to smile and react, it feel utterly stupid and embarrassed and immediately try to hide that emotion showing on my face by frowning 

Q2 - Has anyone felt similar before?

Q3 - especially with my partner and her family, how can I learn not to do this (our families are very different, but I understand both cultures and I love them) 

Q4 - is there a name for this condition? 

Q5 - I feel like I’ve broken my brain by realising this week, so be kind 🤣

1. I have never exactly felt sexual attraction, nor do i understand it. Before i thought sexual attraction meant, admiring someones beauty or something like that yk. Until someone told me what it ACTUALLY meant. I didnt really understood it, but didnt care. But now, anytime i find someone pretty, i get these sexual ( unwanted ) thoughts. I felted uncomfortable and wanted them gone. The weird part is Even tho i have these thoughts, i still don’t desire sex with them. Now Idk if i am repressing sexual feelings without noticing it. 

2. I am also sex-repulsed. But the thing is, Idk why. They don’t really bother me and i don’t want to change my sex-repulsion. Idk if its bad, cuz there were no reasons why i am that way. There were no traumatic reasons. And this is where i doubt. What if i just somehow convinced myself to hate it? And these thoughts have been driving me crazy. Cuz on the inside i do hate sex, but why do my thoughts keep forcing me to have explicit thoughts? I never liked them, i wanted them gone. And now i keep thinking that im convincing myself to hate something. And Idk if its that. 


3. Idk why it happened, Idk why i dont feel sexual attraction, i just never did. Same thing with my sex-repulsion, Idk why its like that. I never really seen it as a bother until i started having thoughts that keep making me uncomfortable. They make me feel kinda sick to my stomach, cuz its like my brain is forcing me to think that. But i dont really agree with my brain, i never liked these thoughts in the first place. But why, why do i hate it if i don’t have any trauma related to it, why? 

The weird part, is that i went to Google for signs of sexual repression, and it said the same thing. ‘’ 1. No interest in sex, 2. Not liking sex, 3. Not liking sexual thoughts’’. Now, this is where in worried. Am i repressing sexual thoughts?
Because i never liked them, is it a problem?

Every single night since I've started seeing the police I've been plagued with awful vivid nightmares about the man that assulted me. Each morning when I wake up i feel more tired then before and from time to time I'll wake up with panic attacks. Anxiety eats at me through the day but it's somewhat managable. It just ends up 10 times worse at night.

Is there anyway I can help this? Any meditation or relaxing I could do? The longer it goes on the more tired and drained I get. I keep falling asleep in class and it's impacting my studies.

This is just how I have been my entire m
Life…very closed off, and just acting as if things do not bother me when they do, I come off as very cold and just take all the blame at all times because I find that easier than facing reality of a situation …each situation is different but I feel as though I’m a coward because instead of facing that truth it’s just easier to take the blame and feel the guilt .. I think this is because it’s just easier than to actually face the real issues at hand especially if I’m the one that’s actually being treated wrong and I deserve better.

I have a good job that had a really down year…I was doing side work for awhile and have friends I consider very close that have been there for a long while (20 years plus) but I’ve been basically by myself for 20 years and never needed any actual help but have been there to provide it many times…now that I do need help (in multiple ways) it’s not like anybody is pushing me aside it’s the fact that I do not feel a connection or trust them enough to ask for help in any way (the mental loneliness aspect or the physical actual things aspect to help me on my feet with new job) 

It just blows my mind that all of this is coming to me all at once and that I’ve lived my whole life brushing all of this aside even to myself… idk what I expect from posting this at all or why I did so or if I put it in the correct spot…I guess I just needed it off my chest as I am having trouble sleeping and I suppose I’m just hoping I’m not alone.

Idk what to do. It's not from sleeping funny cause it persists even into the school day and afterwards, this is the fourth day in a row that I've had to take Advil for it. 
I also found this weird lump on the side of my neck? Just realized how dramatic it makes me feel to bring that up but it's kind of rounded and about the size of the rounded bit on a birdie(I think that's what their called?? The things for badminton)

My mom said she would schedule a doctor's appointment for me after I showed it to her, I've known about it for maybe two weeks now? Something like that? The first time I brought it up I said something about having a weird lump that was freaking me out and my dad explained it away as being the muscle that keeps you from turning your head too far, which made sense at the time so I dropped it. 
And then I kept noticing it and started actually paying attention and realized that it wasn't the muscle because the muscle was beside it so I brought it up again yesterday afternoon 

My body feels like it's deteriorating from the inside out, it hurts worst when I first wake up and when I'm getting ready to lay down at night, it hurts to walk, to lift my arms, my fingers are swollen so I have to fight to get my rings on or off. I'm in so much pain and I'm so scared nobody will believe me or take me seriously.

Especially since I know for a fact I have to be careful of cancer because I have the gene for it, both sides of my family have it in medical history, and I'm fucking terrified. 

So, long story short, my whole body hurts, I found a weird lump on neck, and now I'm having a panic attack because I'm overthinking and health anxiety is getting the better of me. Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this?

we're talking to the point where deciding whether I should eat or not for breakfast tires me;

answering questions from my family members tires me and I avoid answering or say ""uhm"";

deciding on major life changes is impossible, I change my mind daily on major things;

when I apply for jobs online I cannot physically handle it - I will read the description of the job, then doubt that I want to apply and also think about the fact that my CV isn't that tailored to the job; AND as I read a couple more job offers I am completely exhausted already and I need a break from the computer. WHile I have applied to 0 jobs. Because I couldn't make a decision.

  
Also, the jobs are in foreign countries because I need to move out from mine; and I am not sure what country I should apply to. I know this sounds insane but I don't want to be stuck in another country where it's hell again.

How do you solve this brain fog that makes it impossible to make decisions?

mentalhealth,1idnhjl,I hate how social media glorifies mental illness,"Seriously I see it EVERYWHERE it's so annoying. On Instagram I've seen post that said ""your month your trauma"" and it said stuff like ""oh people just don't understand the real you"" and a bunch of ""those who you love the most hurt you the most"" and so many people in the comments were like ""march... So true bestie"" and ""omg so relatable"" like... Seriously these people have never known real trauma in their lives, which is good but glorifying something on the Internet that you've never went through and clearly don't understand is just disgusting. Statistically speaking, 20-30% of people on the Internet are diagnosed with mental health disorders so majority of people on the Internet are more than likely completely fine and just think that 1. It's ok to self diagnose and 2. Think that ""uwu crying in my bed all day bc I'm just a girl 🥺🤪"" means you're severely depressed.

People also treat mental health disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders like a personality trait. On Instagram I saw a reel where all of the comments were saying ""an OCD person and an ADHD person could never get along bc OCD is so clean and organized and ADHD isn't"" 

Not to mention everyone and their mother likes to self diagnose themselves with EVERYTHING. And make the excuse that ""oh you're just classist! Not everyone can afford the luxury of a professional diagnosis like you can!"" And ""saying self diagnosis is invalid is so rude, I know myself and my brain better than any psychiatrists would""...

She is probably my new comfort person. Im planning on coming out to her soon(im lgbtq+) and she will be the first person who will know.

mentalhealth,1idmsfu,Am I wrong?,"This morning, I was supposed to have breakfast with my best friend before school. My best friend texted me directly this morning telling me that she didn't want to have breakfast anymore while I was on my way to her house. My mom got mad and started yelling at me saying that it's all her parents' fault, even if my best friend was the one making the decision. I kept yelling back at her telling her that it wasn't my best friend's parents' fault, and she started calling me best friend an idiot. When I arrived at school, I waited for my best friend, and once she arrived, I told her what my mother said about her. We entered the class as usual, and the way went on like normal. When we got home, my mom received a call by my best friend's mom who started talking to my mom about what she had said to my best friend. My mom completely denied her saying that my best friend was an idiot, which was a complete lie, of course. After she hung up, my mom got absolutely pissed at me. She started yelling and after a while she just told me to eat my food. While I was eating, she asked me where my charger was, when I asked her "" why? "" she said that she didn't want me to have anything and then proceeded to call me a disappointment, a bad daughter and all those kind of things. When she came back upstairs, she told me to finish my food and just go to my room, saying that she didn't want to see me anymore, also adding that the less she saw me, the better, while I was going downstairs to my room. Right now I'm feeling horrible about myself, I'm fighting the urge to not cry my eyes out or do something bad to myself.

I just want to know if I was wrong for reacting like this and if I'm right for feeling so bad about myself right now.",1,2025-01-30 14:20:27,4,1.0,asleep_star19

Is there things I shouldn't say to a therapist? He asked first day if I'm alcohol dependent and if I wanna hurt anyone, I said no, yes I wanna hurt some people, u told him and they haven't 51/50d me, do I wanna go grab guns and do stupid stuff? Already vented about my anger, I googled my name and I think I'm on a fbi watch list? Sad they're trained killers shouldn't they get 51/50d 🤣, anyways I'm gonna do my 4th appointment today, I kinda wanna tell him he pisses me off and he sucks. Yeah so I mean, I had a huge 3 paragraph rant but I exceeded the character limit.

The therapist doesn't seem to be threatened by me. Are any of you on ssi.? Idk what to ask anymore.
I've noticed even if you stick up to abusers or pieces of 💩, they won't quit, it's their whole personality being trash.

mentalhealth,1idltku,i can’t stop sleeping and feel hopeless,"i moved states away from my boyfriend to live with family who can actually help me since my parents didn’t. i can’t continue my online college here or even transfer my credits to the college here that i wouldn’t even be able to start until living in this state for a year. the job market is horrible it took me three months to get a job at taco bell and being diagnosed with anxiety and depression and autism makes me want to puke and cry. i’ve only worked in kitchens and even became an assistant kitchen manager and shift lead at another food place but i feel so fucking useless.

i’m not getting a lot of time to practice driving. my college is on hold so more time working shitty jobs for shitty pay that make me seem as an embarrassment. i’ve begun to resent my family. i had a panic attack and couldn’t stop crying which i haven’t had that in a long time but all my grandma did was yell at me calling me a baby and telling me how they did so much to help me move. i understand that and i feel horrible but i literally can’t get rid of my anxiety. i’ve mustered up enough courage to not cry in front of people and just think about how stupid i was all night instead of sleeping. 

they don’t understand my issues and i don’t either but i really don’t enjoy my brain sabotaging myself with seemingly simple things. i hate being called a baby or dramatic because i would do anything to be normal and not look fucking stupid. i feel like i’m stuck. i’m not getting help that i thought i would and all i want to do is lay in bed and sleep. i’ve been sleeping all day until 3am and just taking sleeping pills to sleep even more. i don’t feel hungry or feel the need to shower or brush my teeth. i’ve been depressed for a lot of my life but not to this level of me giving up. 

why can’t i care about myself? i don’t want to get out of bed. even if i have days where i get up early and eat breakfast and go on a walk and clean my room. the next day it starts over. my head feels like TV static is playing constantly mixed with their dog that they refused to train that barks at literally anything for 10 minutes straight. somehow my grandma says driving isn’t a priority for me despite being 23 and they need me to go to my job at taco bell 30 minutes early despite me telling them i’m not allowed to clock in early. they make me go into jobs with a paper resume like that matters when everything is online and i do everything online just to be ignored or rejected anyways. i’ve grown resentment for them thinking i should just do the bare minimum in life like they have i guess and just think it’s normal to be unhappy. 

i’ve rewritten this post alot trying not to make it long and trying not to seem like a bitch but my main issue is now simply getting out of bed of course, as if i couldn’t already do simple things like every other adult. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. of course my family frowns on suicide blaming the victim which i feared but now wish i could let them know people fucking struggle especially when they seem to be alone",1,2025-01-30 13:26:15,0,1.0,Unable_Piglet1481

mentalhealth,1idikcj,Reached my breaking point,"I'm going through a lot at the moment and I think I hit breaking point last night. My mom has been sick in hospital for about 3 months. When she first went in I was told she was going to die, but she pulled through. Came home after 2 months and I thought everything was going to be okay. 2ish weeks later she's back in super sick and we're now coming up to her being in for 5 weeks. She's old and frail and we've been told she might not survive a big surgery (she may need an organ removed), I'm really struggling to deal with this as I only have my mom and a uncle as blood family. I'm trying to be strong as I'm the one going to the hospital and stuff. But it's all gotten too much, I am constantly sad and feel like I'm living in fear, I've never felt this low before in my life. I've had to take time off work because I just don't feel like I can do it all and I've felt progressively worse. I've spoken to my doctor, I'm in counselling for 'trauma' but nothing seems to work. I've always struggled with my mental health but I've never been this low. Last night, my mom wanted her hospital curtain opened as the girl in the bed had it shut for 3 days straight and she was feeling shut in (my mom's mental ability has been severely affected from this, it's like she's a different person, like someone with early stages of dementia, which she was not like before all this) and when she starts to get down the confusion worsens. I asked the girl if she can open it and was met with such aggression (now in reflection she is also a patient and I don't know what she's going through) but with my low mood and exhaustion, I matched her attitude and ended up having a row, with a patient, in the hospital. I had just reached my breaking point I think. I'm not a confrontational person, and in hindsight I wouldn't have probably done this, but I was just so mad that this girl was screaming that she's the patient and she doesn't care about my mom's needs and I saw red. The nurses are really good and they did get her to open her curtain for a bit for my mum after I left, and we're very comforting to me. But I just feel so ashamed of my behaviour, I'm not an angry person and it's so out of character for me but I'm just on a knife's edge. I'm really struggling today and I cut myself, just a little scratch, hasn't really bled but I just got to a point where I needed to feel something else other than the pain inside. I haven't hurt myself in years and feel like I can't cope. I keep thinking if I wasn't here I wouldn't have to go through the pain, I know I won't do anything that drastic but the thoughts around this are getting louder and louder and I just know I am struggling a lot.

i have been sh since i was 14, 
the thing is tho...since the whole mental health struggling started which was in 2020 i think, i've occasionally heard voices, but when the mental health got really bad i even saw a black shadow who was saying my name and occasionally even talking to me, for some unknown reason they never tested me for anything connected to that EVEN THO i've told a psychiatrist about it, also told the doctors in the hospital... well anyways
i have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since 2022(i think) and have been taking antidepressants also since than.
in the summer they put me off antidepressants and i have been off since then, it has all been ok ig, with occasional ""bad"" days but i have been feeling VERY bad lately and started sh again and i just feel like im fading away again, and with all that the voices came back again, they don't have a schedule or a place, like sometimes i hear them in school or even at home. it just makes me feel even worse and more crazy. idk what to do now? i don't wanna tell my parents anything cuz ik they will only be stressed out and worried.

mentalhealth,1idhgqe,Need help plss,"I know this subreddit isn’t used to give out diagnoses but I was hoping I could get a general idea about what’s wrong with me, and if anyone can help me figure out what I should do.

So right now I feel nervous all the time and whenever I think of doing anything I feel a weird nervous feeling in my chest. This can be caused from literally anything that requires me to take an action; getting out of bed, putting something on to watch, going to shower, going to make food etc. I don’t feel it when talking to people unless they’re new and I usually don’t feel it when I’m out with others. I always feel stopped whenever I try to do anything and it feels like I sometimes just can’t do it. I’ve tried to force myself to do things and not run away from the feeling but it has never improved, and it feels terrible trying to do anything.

Idk if this’ll help but I’ll give some context. 
I think this was triggered by events of last year when I used to put a lot of pressure on myself to do well in uni, while also trying to juggle a relationship and friends. I started getting constant headaches that never went away. From the moment I woke up to the moment I slept. Then one day during an argument with my ex, i felt a deep sharp pain through my heart. It hurt to breathe and I  felt a pain running down my neck. This would happen every so often for about two week. One time it was so bad that I felt like I couldn’t stand at all without feeling like I would collapse. Eventually it went away and the doctors said it was likely heartburn. Then towards the end of the year, I felt manic. I felt pressured by everything from uni to my relationship, I still had the headaches, and I felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t do or focus on anything at all. I was convinced I needed to break off my relationship just to feel normal. The manic sort of behaviour stopped but everything else is still happening to a lesser degree. The main thing that’s affecting me now is that nervous feeling and inability to focus.

Does this sound like anxiety or is this somewhat normal?",2,2025-01-30 08:17:26,2,1.0,slaywrldsol

This isn't a matter of confidence, the last time I wore it I ended up near a switch but I couldn't bring myself to do it. 

I wore crop tops to school, took off the hijab there, and dressed how I wanted. He was previously threatening to move me to the school he works at and telling me that he would go to every school I go to so that he could monitor me (he is a teacher). I took Mary Jane and other stuff to lay my mind off this for a bit, but I ended up getting caught cuz I greened out and thought I had a heart attack. I hate being someone who I am not. I have suggested therapy multiple times, and when he refused I offered to work so I could help myself. nothing helps, I'm lost, I have nothing and life and don't know what to do. they don't believe in mental health, and they always say ""Just talk to me"" but he always ends up making fun of me for my mental health and all I  could do to prevent myself from crying is do Mary Jane. 

what do I do, If I just take off, then I will probably get sent back to my country and married off or beaten, but if I wear it, I can't, ill just end up doing more illegal.

mentalhealth,1id4jy9,"Anyone wanting to cancel a GP appointment to discuss your mental health, read this and it may give you some hope.","I’m in the UK. 

I went to the GP today after booking the appointment over a month ago. I’ve always struggled mentally on and off. 

I’m actually in a really good place at the moment and considered cancelling it because I feel the best I’ve felt in ages. However, I know only too well that this is just a good stage and that things can quickly change so I went ahead as planned. 

I’d already researched potential medication options because I’ve tried Sertraline in the past and didn’t get on with it. I went in knowing what medication I wanted but expecting to fight for it - it costs the NHS more than Sertraline. 

I went in and the GP asked how I was and I completely blurted everything out about how I’d been feeling and how I want to feel. He asked me about my childhood - which was traumatic. He really listened attentively to what I had to say. 

He mentioned medication options and I said that Sertraline was a big no from me. He then listed potential medications he felt would be suitable and this included the one I wanted to trial out. He prescribed me that. 

I then spoke about how the IAPT service wasn’t intense enough for me when I’d tried it in the past. He agreed that it isn’t always the best - he then recommended another NHS endorsed therapy option and referred me for that. 

He then encouraged me to start going to the gym to increase my serotonin levels naturally as I said I didn’t want medication long term. I made a joke about being on maternity leave and the extra cost. He was then able to give me a free gym membership. (I know only some areas offer this though, unfortunately not all). He said to do this as early as possible in the morning - which works out well for me anyway because I have a baby and it means I can be back home before she wakes up. Obviously baby’s dad will be at home - I won’t be leaving her home alone lol. 

He told me to continue eating healthy as well and recommended certain food items packed with nutrients. (Tryptophan etc.)

mentalhealth,1iddxwo,How to actually rest on my days off,"I haven't been able to take any kind of short vacation or just any planned time off since the summer. Been struggling with burn out since October. Because of my type of job, my schedule is all over the place. I often have 2 days off a week, but they aren't consecutive. So my time off is usually spent doing other adulting things that aren't work. Lo and behold it turns out I have 2 consecutive days off coming up and I wanna make the most of it. But I don't actually know what I need to feel like myself again. I feel like I've been in survival mode for a while and the thought of doing something fun feels like extra energy. But I want to want to go out and do something and not just rot my brain.

Any random ideas to help me brainstorm would be appreciated. 

I'm thinking of having my phone off. And I'll probably get out of the house just to get away from my roommate. Cuz I know those 2 things will be draining. ",3,2025-01-30 05:04:52,0,1.0,Shy_dumb_puppy

They're no longer controlled by him and will not go away regardless of if he tells them to or imagines them not there or whatever, he doesn't have visual or auditory hallucinations and is aware it's all in his head but hears their voices as a sort of internal monologue in his head, and will see them with him but like in his head and not really there. He's tried to make more imaginary friends to test if the same thing would happen, and the main two dislike this but he's also unable to replicate it and the others he tries to make are like the ones from his childhood where he's just imagining scenarios.

mentalhealth,1idjmli,When does things get better?,"I apologize for venting, but I really need some tips or inspiration to help me believe that things will get better in life.

The last five years have been difficult for me. I lost both of my grandparents during COVID-19, and my dad had some heart issues, although he is doing fine now. I also went through a breakup, even though I was the one who ended the relationship. During this time, I held four different jobs, none of which I enjoyed, as I pursued a profession that I had no interest in.

All these experiences have taken a significant toll on my mental health. I should mention that I'm very emotional; for every negative event that happens, I tend to take it much harder and often overthink things.

However, I want to improve. I have started working out, and I’m currently training for a half marathon. I’m also eating healthier and trying to get better sleep, even though it’s challenging due to insomnia caused by stress and anxiety. I’m receiving help from a therapist, and we have talked about finding comfort and peace. This means that whenever something bad happens, we should always look for something to be grateful for and return to a safe place. Right now, I feel like I have lost that comfort and safe space, making it difficult to find peace when I’m constantly worried about many things.

Has anyone else experienced a similar journey in life? If so, how have you managed to sort it out? The fear of the future can be overwhelming, and it often leaves one feeling unsafe anywhere.

mentalhealth,1ideusq,I’m at a loss,"At the beginning of December I started waking up with severe anxiety and panic attacks. 
I have been diagnosed with cptsd, GAD and panic disorder. 

The thing that triggered it was Christmas approaching and my son finishing up primary school and heading to high school. My psychologist basically told me I was grieving the loss of my little boy. I should add that at this time I was on 20mg of lexapro and 30mg of mirtazapine( was on this combination for years)

My physical and mental symptoms got so bad my family called an ambulance. Long story short ambulance came gave me orlanzapine to calm me down after being extremely heightened for a week straight which helped. They wanted me to get a prescription for it from my GP but he wouldn’t allow it as I was already on mirtazapine. So instead gave me a script for Valium as a PRN. 

Things were okay for a week or so then bam. It hit me like a ton of bricks again. Woke up panicked anxious racing heart felt like I had barely slept and had this impending doom feeling. An ambulance was called again. Same thing then went okay for a week or two with having 2.5mg of Valium here and there when I started to feel anxious. 

Then it happened again and again and again. 
I have a therapist and have spoken to a psychiatrist who changed my meds to 100mg of Zoloft and 45 mg of mirtazapine. This has been the case for around 3 weeks now. However still having the same issue waking up panicking racing heart, cold sweats and doom. I ended up in the ED last week. The mental health dr I saw wanted me to try prazosin and if that didn’t help quetiapine. 
Well took prazosin that night and became violently ill (vomiting,diarrhoea, dizziness, yellow skin and shortness of breath.) so stopped that immediately. I then went and got a script the next day for quetiapine. 25mg. I started that night. Woke up good the next day and the next then the same things started happening again and still happening. 

I’m seriously at a loss and I don’t know what to do. I’m ready to throw in the towel.

mentalhealth,1id8hjz,I truly believe I'll never be enough for anyone,"When one person treats you in a way that makes you feel not good enough, you can try convincing yourself it's a them problem. But when multiple people treat you like that, it really solidifies that you'll never be enough.

I have dated two people exclusively. The first one ended when I found out they'd had a girlfriend the whole time and had been seeing multiple other girls (after a year of knowing each other, and seven months of exclusivity) - he called me an option, then left me behind with ease, like I'd never even existed. The second guy I dated, I struggled to trust because of that past experience. He made me believe he genuinely liked me, gave me a false sense of security to start opening up, then less than 24 hours after telling me he liked me, he pretty much said he didn't mean to love-bomb me but it won't work because I go too 'slow', and then he cut me off completely. Found someone else like what we had never happened. I'm not worth the patience of waiting. 

I moved on from these people in the sense I'm not waiting for them. But I can't move on from how being treated like that made me feel. I feel like the smallest person on earth, I'll never live up to anyone's expectations, and everyone is going to leave eventually. These feelings have seeped into my few friendships, too. I spent the day with my friends today, and I felt sick the whole time because I don't think I do enough for them, no matter how hard I try. I feel like the odd one out, and eventually they'll leave me too.

I care deeply about everyone around me, but they're never going to care as deeply about me. I'm so replaceable, there's always going to be someone better than me who they can easily move onto and forget about me, whether its platonic or romantic. I used to see it as having boundaries and only opening up at a pace that's comfortable to me, but maybe I really am the problem and I am fundamentally not enough. I feel like I can't forgive myself for it, I hate myself. I feel so lonely and all I want is to be wanted back.",4,2025-01-30 00:51:59,3,0.84,Sufficient-Ice6123
mentalhealth,1idigr1,Why do I get so fragile after going out for a couple days in a row?,"Bit of a content warning because I mention things like suicide and self harm. Not in depth but still, mentioned. 

So I’ve been going to this fitness program for the past couple days, it goes for about 6 hours a day and is set to go for the whole week. I’ve just gotten finished with day 4 and I’ve noticed since yesterday, after day 3, I just started to have all sorts of negative mental symptoms. I hated doing anything, small things impacted me more, I started asking myself if maybe there was something about me that was the reason I’m not happy, if maybe I just can’t be happy, if I should even live anymore. Today it’s worse, I’m getting angry at everything, every little thing is making me (almost) cry, I’m hating things I loved a week ago, some slight urges to hurt myself and I just can’t really get myself to do anything. 

Some more info is that this has been a lot of socialising and I’ve been a tad bit isolated the past two months, I’ve only really socialised with other people since late December, other than that it’s just been my family, one interaction that didn’t go well and the occasional conversation with another owner while I’m taking my dog out. I also have autism which I think could be related to this. I don’t know though, maybe it was just today because I got upset at not being able to do something, and plus I didn’t get as much time to myself this time since more people showed up and wanted to ask me things, talk to me and show me stuff. Should I be more clear to people that I like to have ‘social breaks’ throughout the day? How could I say that in a way that doesn’t come off as rude?",1,2025-01-30 09:22:11,0,1.0,Jacks_burner
mentalhealth,1idegc3,Immediately crying when feeling simple emotions - how to stop?,"Not really sure how to describe it but I've gotten out of a slump recently (like last year) and reconnected a bit with my emotions, but I'm running into an issue that's plaguing everyday interactions. It kind of feels like I just don't know what to do with emotions anymore, after a couple decades of what I could best describe as disassociating, so whenever I feel any (be that sadness, happiness, just ""wow that's awesome"", etc) I immediately tear up and start to cry.

Now when I'm just browsing online and cry at random it's not an issue, though would be nice to not do that also. The problem is not being able to control this when talking to someone. Sometimes it's a little understandable, like difficult talks with my ex-partner (who told me breaking down crying during these was part of why she broke up, but anyway), and sometimes a friend will ask me if I'm enjoying the food they made and I'll start crying, which naturally worries them, and until I can collect myself enough to talk again everything's a mess.

It wouldn't be so bad if I could just explain through tears but it's to the point where I just can't speak sometimes. I get choked up and nothing comes out when I try to speak. If I can I'll pull out a notes app and write stuff instead.

It might be related, but this happens when I laugh sometimes too. I'll start laughing and maybe 10% of the time I cannot stop myself, start crying at the same time, but usually end up being unable to breathe, gasping for air for a few minutes while anyone who doesn't know me well freaks out.

Unfortunately not in a financial position to seek therapy, though I can guarantee it'd be someone getting paid $300/hr to console me while I cry if I did lmao

Sorry in advance for (If I'll do them) my mistakes, misspelling, English is not my native language.

So.. I dunno if anyone is going deep into lives there, but.. I think I should do just that, I need to get at least SOME weight off of my shoulders.

I am a male, live in Russia, well.. trying to live at least. I wouldn't say that my life was completely terrible, but it.. became this way, somehow. Mentally, at least. 
All my childhood I got fckn terrorized by my father, that's why I grew up too shy, complexed. I'm too shy to seek for help if I need it, I'm too shy to talk to someone, anyone (with my voice, it is). I'm complexing about my body, my voice, my very existence itself. I grew just.. tired. In my life I had only 1 little group of friends and about 2 years ago I lost the last one, unfortunately he died. And since.. I live in a complete isolation, I try to act normal, I try to say that everything is okay because who does fucking care? 

But it's getting harder and harder to suppress, hold back my emotions, my real emotions. I tried everything. Some classes ""to be a better person in social terms"" and etc. Nothing worked, no matter how hard and how long I tried. It all started, the things I try to beat, in.. about 11 years. Now I'm 20, so I'm trying to beat it for 9 years already and.. I can't, no matter what I do. My situation worsens, I'm in a complete fucking isolation. A while ago, 6 months to be exact I got a boyfriend, but due it being a distance relationship, I still feel so.. Alone, empty. I don't know what to do anymore, even he doesn't chat with me often, mostly.. About hour a day max.. And not every day even, I.. don't know if I'm happy with this relationship anymore, but who cares.. I don't want to be COMPLETELY alone. But I'm tired. I tried to end it all, tried a couple of times. But I just.. can't. Every time I just fall into tears. You may think I just want attention, down vote me to ashes, I'll be okay with it honestly. Because it is truth. I didn't get to have any attention when I was kid, so it evolved into craving. Into my.. Dream? I don't know how to call it honestly. I don't want to feel empty, I don't want to feel void, to be isolated. I just really want some affection, to feel like I'm needed, like I'm loved. Maybe I'm asking for too much from this life, but whatever.. I have no friends and feels like I have no couple even.. I'm literally alone. I try to draw, I try to suppress my emotions, but it feels like I'm just getting worse. I started drawing a bit ago even, some people I rarely talk to says I draw really well due to lack of any experience.. also, I can't even.. be fucking myself. I'm a furry (another reason to downvote tbh) and it feels like whole world hates me for that. 

I just..

Really don't want to feel isolated.. Really, now the question.. do I ask for too much? Should I even fucking try at this point if nothing works? I'm just continuing to hate myself, while trying to get up, but.. I cant",1,2025-01-30 09:02:16,12,1.0,Alternative_Kale9300
mentalhealth,1id99ze,Im being harassed by my ex best friend,"(15 f) Me and this girl used to be best friends. She was very horrible to me the whole time. She would make fun of me for being overweight, even though my body is the way it is because of medical issues I cannot control. She would make fun of my acne, which was also a spawn from my medical issue. She would embarrass me to make herself look better and smarter. And whenever I set boundaries telling her to stop doing all this, she would continue to do so. But whenever she set boundaries and i didnt follow them she would sometimes resort to punching me in the stomach. When her and I stopped being friends, I asked her to give me some space. Which 100% means leave me alone. She would start interrupting conversations i was having with mutual friends. And she started to randomly befriend any friends i had that she wasn't friends with already. In December two days before school ended, I finally told her to leave me alone and respect my personal space. And it worked, to an extent. My close friends have also mentioned that she has been really clingy with them recently, even though she claims that i was clingy with her. I later found out that she turned two of my best friends against me, and one of my closest friends never speaks to me unprompted. The other has remained just as painfully awkward with me, but giving me the information that she truthfully and genuinely turned them against me. At my performance for School of Rock in late January, I was walking with my father to go to my brother and mother. She proceeded to jump at the chance to speak to him, ignoring any history with her and I. Stealing any attention given to me from MY LITERAL FATHER. During our friendship, she would consistently make fun of my father, calling him fat and stupid. To be honest, I would also say rude things about my father, but i was in my ""teenage angst phase"" and he is also directly related to me. It was not her place to say those things about my father. And whenever I hosted any sleepovers with her, she would never thank us for the effort we put forth to host her at our house. Her father would also ask us to take her home, even considering she lives 45 minutes from my house. They never thanked us. I have repeatedly asked her to leave me alone and yet I for some reason have not succeeded. At this point, I want the whole situation to be over, and to be left alone.

mentalhealth,1idawol,""" Don't try to run after love, eventually it will come to you. ""","I was lost. you realize you are just a mix of other people expectations.

Loneliness is like a shadow that accompanies us, even in the busiest moments of life. No matter how surrounded by people we may be, there is a feeling of emptiness that persists, 
a silent echo that resonates within us. It is in these moments that the desire for reciprocal love becomes even more intense.

Longing for reciprocal love is not just longing for someone's presence by our side, but also longing for a deep connection, where our thoughts, feelings and aspirations intertwine harmoniously. 
It is wanting not only to be loved, but also understood, accepted and valued in all our complexity.

The search for reciprocal love often leads us to dive into relationships that promise to fill the void of loneliness, only to discover that they are nothing more than fleeting illusions.
 It's a painful cycle of hope and disappointment, where each new encounter fills us with expectations, only to leave us even more empty when we don't find what we're looking for.

However, it is important to remember that true reciprocity cannot be forced or rushed. It flourishes naturally when two souls find themselves in tune,
 when there is a genuine exchange of love, respect and mutual care. It is a journey of self-discovery and personal growth, where we learn to love and be loved in the most authentic way possible.

As we navigate the ups and downs of this journey, it's crucial not to lose sight of the importance of cultivating a healthy relationship with ourselves. Loneliness should not be seen as a burden, 
but rather as an opportunity to reconnect with our own essence, to strengthen ourselves and prepare ourselves to receive the love we deserve.

Therefore, even in the depths of loneliness, it is important to keep the flame of hope and faith in reciprocal love alive. Because, at the right time and in the right place,
 the universe will conspire in our favor, guiding us towards the person who will make us realize that loneliness was just a necessary break in our journey towards true love.",3,2025-01-30 02:42:49,1,1.0,Piranha_Vegan0850

A few years ago, I (ftm, minor) was being bullied a lot by these two girls in my class, one was also a huge transphobe. One of their main ways of bullying me was making comments about my chest, one of them, the transphobe, we'll call her E did it most. The other girl, A, didn't make as many comments but physically hit me quite a bit and insulted me alot.

For some backstory, I was ""friends"" with both of these girls because we were sorta in the same friend group (though everyone was toxic to eachother). Therefore, the two knew about me being trans and about me having mental health issues.

Anyways, one day E and A were just being assholes to me and said their usual bullshit. Insulting me for being overweight, calling me slurs, calling me ""mental"" and a ""cutter"" because I sh and making fun of my family history of addiction and abuse. But then their comments turned sexual.

I'm not gonna say exactly what they said because I don't think it'd be allowed on this sub, but it was basically ""Noone will ever want to be with you sexually because you have a back curve"" (they said it in much more vulgar terms). Then E started trying to tell me some stupid pickup lines and I told her to stop. She didn't. She grabbed my chin and forced me to look at her.

Then, she groped my chest and yanked it towards her, I told her again to stop but she didn't. She did it a couple more times until eventually break was over and we had to go back to class. But for the rest of the day, I just acted ""normal"". I wasn't that upset by it. Idk if I felt used to it or if I didn't relise how severe it was or whatever.

I actually didn't even fully process this shit until last night, I was looking through my old journal and found the journal entry of the night it happened, and the exact date. It was on September 25th 2023. For some reason it just...hit hard? It's hard to describe. But it's like I finally relised what happened.

mentalhealth,1idd0ex,“Ending your life is selfish”,"
I’ve seen so many posts about how ending your life is selfish, “what about the people who love you?”. What if you have nobody? “Reach out and find help”. I’ve been reaching out for years, I’ll be 30 this year. The thought of that brings me to tears. 30 years old. I’ve been in therapy for years, I’ve recently started a new kind of therapy, EMDR. I was also recently diagnosed with autism. But my thing is, I genuinely believe that some people are just not equipped to handle survival. At this point that’s all it is, it isn’t a life, it’s just trying to make it through each day.
Unfortunately, I am transgender, ftm. I am also black. The world has been an awfully unkind and scary place. I have never been comfortable with these two things about myself. I try to have pride in who I am but honestly, I hate it. I hate myself. I think I’ve been fighting the better half of 30 years to not end myself and to just keep pushing because “things get better”. But do they actually? I am tired. I spend most of my time at home besides when I go to work, mainly bc I am so paranoid about people due to past things that have happened to me. And honestly, there is nothing here for me. I could go on and on to explain the reasoning as to why I don’t think I’m equipped for this life, but I’m not sure how long of a post that would be. And I know, you’re probably thinking “wow this dude is fucking pathetic”. I think you’re right. And the worst part of all? I am so terrified of everything around me but I am also scared to commit. I am so miserable and my chest is such a huge void and my head never shuts the fuck up and lets me breathe. I’ve never been a religious person but I don’t know. What if something does happen after death and I’m just stuck there? I just want everything to stop. I think it’s more selfish to want a suffering person to remain here just so you can have them in your lives. Right? I don’t know. At either rate, there isn’t even anyone in my life that would be affected. I’m sure my job will hate to have to go through the hassle of replacing me, but I’m sure they’ll manage. 
I’m sorry if this doesn’t have much fluidity or doesn’t make much sense, there’s just so much to say and my mind is such a racket especially with everything going on in the US right now but I’ll just leave it here.

mentalhealth,1idat1n,Why Do Hurt People Hurt Other People?,"
I’ve been reflecting on the idea that “hurt people hurt people,” and I wanted to open up a discussion about why this happens. From what I’ve learned, it seems like people who are carrying deep emotional wounds sometimes end up unintentionally passing that pain onto others. But why does this happen?


Here are a few reasons that stood out to me:

	1.	Projection – Instead of facing their own pain, some people redirect it onto others, often without realizing it.

	2.	Repeating Trauma Cycles – If someone grew up in a toxic environment, they might unknowingly recreate those patterns in their relationships.

	3.	Difficulty Regulating Emotions – When emotions run high, pain can come out as anger, defensiveness, or even cruelty.

	4.	A Need for Control – If someone once felt powerless, they might lash out as a way to regain control over their emotions or surroundings.

	5.	Low Self-Worth – When a person struggles with feeling unworthy, they may push others away or sabotage relationships.


Of course, this doesn’t excuse hurtful behavior, but understanding where it comes from might help break the cycle. Have you ever experienced this, either in yourself or others? How do you think we can help stop this pattern? I would love to hear about anyone who was able to overcome these struggles and how it changed their lives.",2,2025-01-30 02:37:51,1,1.0,grass0hopper

mentalhealth,1idduak,Childhood Trauma getting in the way of life.,"Sorry in advance for whoever decides to read this. I shouldn’t be. But I am.

Growing up, I didn’t have the best life. But I always had food, water, clothes (clean or not) and some type of entertainment. So I was physically cared for. I didn’t realize I would get ignored, forgotten, left to my own devices, told to shut up when others are talking and yelled at for other people’s mistakes.

My lovely partner of over 10 years, whom we shared living situations, until recently, and we share a son who is under 3 years old. Had urged me to get therapy for years. Me being stubborn thinking I didn’t have time, never did. I didn’t realize just how depressed I was. I should have listened to the words of my best friend. I didn’t listen. Until I lost her. 

I’ve finally started therapy, finally started getting the support for my depression. It just hurts 1000x worse that I don’t have her by my side as I start my healing journey. Luckily our son is still being cared for, thanks to her family. I know I can’t support him emotionally or physically when I’m struggling to support myself. I can come see and hang out with whenever I am able to. I am in a safe place with a friend of mine. I am not alone.

I just wish I could make amends for the way I treated her after all these years. I had become so depressed I shut everyone out. Friends, family and even her. I treated her horribly, lashed out in anger, frustration. I realize that I only ever did with her because in my mind I knew she was a safe place. I never meant for it to be directed towards her. And now I feel like a stranger towards the person whom I thought I would live with and die with.

It wasn’t just my relationships that suffered. I managed to get a good paying job to support myself and my family. But it took so much of my energy and time that I was being drained. I’ve lost that position at this point. Because I mentally checked out from the stress of both work and home.

At this point I don’t think she would ever get back with me, ever. I have burned the bridge through my pain and hurt. I never meant to. But I have to take responsibility for the actions I took, even when my mind wasn’t in the right place. I have to learn to focus on myself. 

Once I feel like I have a strong foundation, I hopefully will be able to help raise my son through his life. I don’t want him to make the same mistakes I made. I don’t want him to have the same sadness deep inside that I feel. I want him to be happy. Just like I wanted my partner to be happy. Even if it cost me my happiness. I should be happy too.

I will find it eventually. But for now, I exist. For now, I will hold on. For now, I will let the emotions run their course. I’ve suppressed them all my life. It’s time to learn to be human, and stop being a robot. Oh I miss my honeybee, I don’t think I was the flower for you; too many thorns. 

Enjoy what you can and listen to your friends, family and most of all your partners, your best friends. They see the side of you that you can’t see.",1,2025-01-30 05:00:06,0,1.0,salgood01

I felt annoyed by everything but also inexplicably lonely. 

I had one of the worst panic attacks I had experienced in months later that night and ever since then i’ve been in this dissociative state that i can’t find my way out of. Everyone keeps asking me if I am okay, and I can’t shake the feeling i’m being incredibly annoying or just at outright miserable to be around. I have spurts where I feel like I can be normal, but it all comes crashing down within a few hours and I feel upset again. It’s not just a normal level of upset but somewhat suffocating and i feel the need to ask for assurance from others to make sure they aren’t angry with me.

There’s this constant bubble of frustration in my chest that is enraged at everything, but simultaneously ashamed with the idea that i’m causing others to be miserable. I am grasping on to some normalcy within my personality but it feels so hard to reach. I keep being told I am irritable when all I want to be is liked by others and make sure they feel good.

I understand that is a bit of a childish sentiment, but it seems to be driving most of this. I want to know what’s going on and why I feel like i’m not in my body. This has never happened. ",2,2025-01-30 00:38:32,0,1.0,Infinite_Sail8084

I've been rejected in terms of relationships for my entire life and only just recently have felt like I have found the right friendship group and had always felt as if I was misplaced and not with the right people. I also don't like to self diagnose but due to me not really being able to pay for the doctors appointments to get a diagnosis,  I'm fairly confident that I have ADD as well as being on the spectrum to some degree.

I’m constantly thinking about things from the past so i clean to stop the thoughts and not just like normal cleaning like i’ve had my friends complain because of the constant smell of bleach in my room. Anyways though i’ve tried getting out of the house and distraction work for a short amount of time but it’s been making me unmotivated and depressed idk what to really do anymore.

mentalhealth,1idc6ku,How do I make going outside more bearable?,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety in my teens, then agoraphobia in my early twenties, but now I’m waiting to hear back about ASD testing. Also diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, and one psychologist thought I was bipolar 1. The only diagnosis I’m sure is correct is the ADHD. Regardless, going outside is miserable for me. It’s so bright outside. I also feel like I’m being perceived at all times-like one minute, one person might glance at me and the next minute, another person might walk by and do the same. That bothers me. The sounds of the outside world can sometimes feel really alarming and when I jump, I get rlly embarrassed. Also, all of the clashing noise is overstimulating. Being outside of the house really just provokes my anxiety for so many reasons and the longer I’m out, the worse it gets. Does anyone have any advice?

However, I'm just not feeling any better after a bit of a shock to the system two weeks ago.  I'm pondering talking to somebody even if just once.  A few questions for anybody who would like to answer.  

*Do any good text-based therapy options exist (not video chat or in person)?

*If you're going to a psychologist, I don't think medications are involved, but regardless, can you announce that you would never be open to medications as a ground rule, right off the bat?

*Can a regular psychologist talk to you about any issues, whether it's depression or OCD or whatever?

For as long as I can remember, I haven’t cared about anyone or anything beyond what’s necessary. I don’t expect gifts, love, or loyalty. If someone betrays me, they’re gone—no second chances. If someone tries to hurt my family, I make sure they regret it—for life. I haven’t shed a tear over anything except for exams for over 13 years, and I don’t talk to people unless absolutely necessary for work.

I’m not rude or arrogant. I treat people with respect and kindness. But I’ve become cold—indifferent to almost everything. Emotions feel like a weakness, and I refuse to let anyone have power over me. And my parents have started describing me as cruel. But yet, a part of me wonders… should I feel something? Not love, not vulnerability, just *something*.

I don’t want to lose my edge. I don’t want to become soft. But is there a way to reconnect with emotion, even a little, without giving up control? Where do you even start?

mentalhealth,1id3k5b,What should we do?,"Hey,

My main problem is my grandmother. She is 73 right now, and she has a drinking problem combined with dementia. She has been drinking for a few years now, and her situation is really bad. She lives in an aparment building, and when she drinks she starts shouting like a madman, and sometimes destroys stuff in her apartment. She broke her arm a few months back, but could not remember how she did it. She started blaming my mother instead. 

Every time we try to visit her she is drunk, nevermind the time. Even if its 10 AM or 5 PM, she is either drunk and curses everything, or drunk and sleeping. 

She can be really dangerous too. There were multiple occasions when we saw her sleeping beside a lit cigarette, that was under her curtain. We caught her with the gas stove on one time too. 



She also has dementia, and does not remember things when she gets to be sober. She denies that she drinks, even though we showed her proof of her drinking and shouting. We also got multiple reports from her neighbours, that we should do something with her. We would like to put her in a nursing home, or some institue where she can get help, but she refuses everything, and does not want to move or change, but we do not belive that her situation can remain like this.



Anyone who has been in a similar situation, what did you do?

mentalhealth,1idbnn6,Am I messed up? Probably.,"TW: talk about physical illnesses

Sometimes I want really horrible things to happen to me. Like getting some horrid disease. Recently my mind has been very focused on cancer, and early on-set alzheimers. But in the past my mind has focused on things like blindness or limb loss.

I don't actually want any of those things to happen to me, but I want the attention that it would bring. I feel like nobody pays attention to me. Nobody listens to me when I speak. Any time I try to say something I get halfway through my sentence before the person I'm speaking to cuts me off and says their thing and immediately moves the conversation along and doesn't let me get back to what I was saying. This kind of thing has happened to me since I was a child. My childhood friends did it (I don't have any friends anymore so I don't need to worry about them doing it), my entire family ALWAYS does it to me it's impossible to speak to them, and my coworkers do it.

But if I had something awful happen to me then they would HAVE to pay attention to me.

I hate it when people's attention is directed towards me when it's regarding mental health, but with physical health it's different because I don't feel like it's my fault. I feel weak and pathetic and that I've done something heinous and have inconvenienced those around me when it's in regards to my mental health.

But if something so horrible and sudden happened to me, like if I was in a car crash and lost my legs or something, then it wouldn't be my fault because it would just be a freak accident.

I know this is very messed up, but I can't help thinking of these things. Like all the time. And now I think I might actually have early on-set alzheimers because my mind's been set on it for a while and I started playing a game that has a character with that disease in it and now it's cemented into my brain that I am also developing it.",1,2025-01-30 03:18:06,0,1.0,ilydollface

mentalhealth,1id0rlg,Whats wrong with me,"This is a little long I have been going through lost of emotions for the the last 5 years, I feel like I’m losing my sense of reality. When I go out with friends, everything feels normal in the moment, but the second I get home, it’s like it never happened. It feels like a dream or something I made up, and I start doubting if it was even real. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not in my own body, like I’m watching the world through someone else’s eyes. I always feel like the room around me is spinning, I did blood tests etc. everything is fine. My emotions change so fast, and I don’t understand why. I can love someone one day and hate them the next for no reason at all. My mom, for example, one day, I can’t stand her, and the next, she’s my favorite person, even when she hasn’t done anything differently, I fight people in my mind. I miss everything, even things that just happened. I’ll eat something, and five minutes later, I already feel nostalgic about it. It’s like the past is haunting me. I get attached to objects in a way that doesn’t feel normal. If I lose something, even a pen, it feels like I’ve lost a part of myself. The grief is overwhelming, like I’ve done something irreversible. I put people on pedestals in my head treating them like they’re perfect, almost god-like but the moment I see them again, I realize they’re just... people. And then I go home and idealize them all over again. This used to happen a lot with my teachers. I’ve had phases where I suddenly couldn’t swallow. I went to doctors, and they said it was anxiety, but the thing is, I don’t feel anxious but my body acts like it’s constantly in crisis. Lately, I’ve been seeing hallucinations. Weird floating shapes in my room, like stickers in the air. Sometimes I hear music. I have the worst attachment issues. The second someone actually cares about me, I push them away. When relationships get too serious, I just leave. Block them. Disappear. I don’t even know why, but it makes me feel sick to be loved for no reason. I always feel homesick—even when I’m at home. Sometimes, I’ll be having a full breakdown, and I suddenly tell myself that I'm faking it, that I’m overreacting. It makes me doubt everything I feel, like I don’t even know what’s real anymore. For the past five years, some nights, I get this uncontrollable shaking, like I’m freezing from the inside, but my body isn’t actually shaking when I look at my hands. It lasts for an hour or less. Even though I feel cold, I start sweating, and every muscle in my body tenses up, sometimes it's like something is sitting on my chest. My heart randomly hurts, like a stabbing pain, and every time it happens, I’m convinced I’m having a heart attack. I’ve passed out in public before because of it. I have extreme mood swings one moment, I feel like the happiest person alive, and the next, I feel completely empty. It’s not even sadness, just a hollow feeling, like something is missing inside me. I don’t even know what I look like. Sometimes I'm fat and then I'm fit, I can’t picture myself in my head. It’s like I don’t have a stable sense of who I am at all. You will prob tell me I should see a professional, here the problem starts my family never recognizes our metal health, I was never allowed to be sad, they always told me I have everything I want and I shouldn't be sad,I don't have financial support i'm 18  my fam wouldn't allow me to work so I can't save up for therapy I'm waiting to leave for uni, until then I need help..",3,2025-01-29 19:28:18,3,0.81,Financial_Status_954

My teeth are yellow, and either im paranoid or my gums are receding.

I am currently taking fluoxetine (prozac) on a very low dose, with my doctor trying to get me off it since I was diagnosed with depression about 3-4 years ago, at time time i was blind to my depression and refused to accept it/help it, taking medication, going to therapy, and being surrounded by friends really helped me. over the past year i was also diagnosed with anxiety/ocd where i would get panic attacks mainly at night & i am taking hydroxyzine (only taking nights i get panic attacks)

 this past week i got my worst one yet (posts from past redditors who had the same problem helped me sm im so grateful for all of yall :) ) then a few days ago i got hit with a major depression episode just by one thought, the thought that everyday has been feeling the same for me, and i just spiraled. i was at school and by the time lunch came around i had lost my appetite and just became a bundle of nerves, begging to be free of school. 

the distraction of doing school work seems to help me, but it’s not like i can constantly distract myself with it. 
this is so different for me yet so familiar, it’s like i traveled back 4 years in time yet this time, knowing im majorly depressed. having a deep depression a second time hits worse knowing how good it felt to go back to normal :( i am clinging onto straws about how good my life was literally 2 weeks ago. 

im trying everything i can to go back but that lingering thought of loneliness and being stuck is still here and i feel as if i have a gaping hole in my heart. i’m watching my favorite movies, playing my favorite games, listening to my favorite songs, eating my favorite food and everything is so bland and boring. i’m thinking of going back to a therapist then from there seeing if i go back to a higher dose/new meds. i just miss my old self :( come back.",1,2025-01-30 02:22:37,0,1.0,anon86340

My current hyperfixation is the video-game Mouthwashing. It impressed me and I love it so much. But one of the reason I love it that much is because of how it was one of the few pieces of horror media that kept me both feeling uneasy and in shock.

I’ve been dealing with narcissistic abuse from my ex for a while, and it feels like no matter what I do, I keep falling back into the same toxic patterns. The biggest reason I still talk to him is because we have a kid together. He keeps sucking me back in and recently did it again. He discarded me and is claiming he was arrested and his phone is broken but I couldn’t find an arrest record and he is just dodging talking about it to me at all. 

Last night, I called his friend and left desperate messages (like, 8 times) because my ex’s phone isn’t working, he said he was going to call me, and I needed to talk to him. His friend blocked me. That wasn’t just a one-time thing, though. I’ve constantly reached out and tried to get him to talk to me when he’s avoiding me, and it’s honestly driving me insane. He’s done this to me before, and instead of accepting that he’s not going to engage, I get desperate and start contacting anyone connected to him, friends, family, whoever I think can reach him.

I’ve tried to stop doing this, but it feels like I can’t stop myself once I hit a certain point. Every time I don’t get the response I want or get ignored, I feel more anxious, and I just keep going, calling, texting, trying to get him or anyone around him to engage. I’m so ashamed of how I’ve acted. I know this behavior is toxic and unhealthy, but in the moment, it feels like the only way to get some kind of closure or connection.

mentalhealth,1id8uq6,My relationship and my life are falling apart because of my financial situation.,"Hello, good afternoon. I need to vent.  

I’ve been unemployed for a year and a half. I have a 3-year relationship that is dying due to my financial crisis, and I have pending debts. What should I do?  

I’m facing problems in my relationship because of my lack of money (I’m a 34-year-old man). My girlfriend, who is 26, has been supporting me, but she’s told me she’s feeling tired. We live together in a 260-square-meter apartment and have rented out three rooms, which has helped us save on rent. She’s spent almost $2,000 on home repairs because I couldn’t contribute half due to my situation. We agreed that I would take care of groceries and utilities (electricity, water, internet), but the little money I get is only enough to cover those bills. I can’t afford to take her out to dinner, go to the movies, visit a beach, or even buy her flowers. I haven’t been able to give her anything for her birthday for two years.  

I feel very sad because, as a man, this makes me feel weak. But I try to stay strong and believe in God that good things will happen soon and that I’ll get a job to support her more and contribute more at home, which will also help me feel better about my self-esteem. I don’t know if anyone here has gone through something like this and can help me cope with my mental crisis and occasional depressive episodes.  

The person supporting me is my mom with her savings, these last two months. I’m left with nothing for myself.  

On top of that, I have debts of around $300. One of the people I owe money to has been messaging my girlfriend, calling me a deadbeat and a thief. (We worked together on a project a year ago, and I used that money to pay for our home at the time.) He’s saying all of this because I can’t pay him right now. He used to be a friend, and I’ve spoken to him to ask him not to involve my girlfriend in this because it’s between him and me, but I know very well what his intentions are. I’ve told him twice that I’m actively looking for a job to pay off my debts; it’s not that I don’t want to pay him.  

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve told him that if he messages my girlfriend again about our issues, he’ll have to face me directly because, honestly, I’ve had enough.  

I’m sorry if this is all too long, but I have no one to talk to. I don’t want to be in this situation. I know things will change at some point; I just hope it’s soon. I don’t want everything I have now—my relationship, the place where I live—to fall apart because of my financial crisis.  

If anyone can give me advice, I’m willing to work on anything. This is the situation I’m going through.

mentalhealth,1id8ajq,Mental Health Recovery,"Mental illness destroyed my life. I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. I was doing very well as a truck driver and living with my parents. But then, I devolved into delusion and lost touch with reality. The extent of my delusion is too far far to list here...

I thought my dad was evil and I became violent. They kicked me out of their home for good. I became homeless until I found SPA housing, where I stayed in a community residence for one year. 

This is when I started hearing voices, it would sound like girls whispering my name. I thought I was haunted by spirits. 

I managed to move up in the program into an apartment with two other roommates. I was still in psychosis for another year. It got so bad I was hospitalized again. They gave me an injection of anti-psychotics called Invegga Sustenna, and the symptoms of psychosis disappeared. 

I came back to reality only to look at all the damage I had done. My parents have seen the worst of it. They will no longer allow me to stay with them anymore. This was the crushing blow to my life.

Now I am stuck in SPA housing on SNAP, public assistance, applying for disability and section 8.

This is what my life was reduced to. I am locked in my room most of the day. I only work 3-6hrs a week. I go to treatment once a week and practice recovery in a twelve step program. 

So, will I ever recover? Will I ever make it out of SPA housing? Will I continue to the cycle of hospitalizations? Will I ever get my life back?

I can only pray to god at this point. I'm at his mercy. And unfortunately it's going to take time. I don't mind the effort, I'm willing to put all I have into recovery...

...It was just such a crushing blow to my life, it brought me straight to homelessness. It's not fair and I suffer because of it. My quality of life dropped drastically...

Anyone can relate? Is this common for people of this disorder? Does mental illness of this level always result in homelessness, or low quality of life? Will I ever get to work again? Is it possible for me to have a family one day? Will I be alone forever?

Please help, I'm desperate!

By the way, I'm a 34 year old male and this all happened about two years ago, around the time of the pandemic coronavirus..

She's not working right now and she can be quite controlling/anxious, and these days she is often micro-managing me and sometimes berates me for small things I forget to do or when I procrastinate.

I've talked to her what feels like a thousand times about how I feel when she says certain things to me or when she starts to freak out on me, but I think it's quite hard for her to get a grip on her feelings most of the time and no matter how much I've tried to set boundaries or talk things out with her it never really solves anything. I probably don't always respond very well and we sometimes get in a vicious cycle where no progress is made. 

I feel like I'm pushing on a wall most of the time and I've stopped believing that she will change in a meaningful way. I dont think our relationship is lost, we still share precious moments on a regular basis but I am unfortunately convinced that when she lashes out on me, I have no tools to protect myself with. I just want to run away as far away as I can from her when she behaves that way. 

When my dad's here things are better. He's a reassuring presence for her and she can talk about things with him which she can't with me. She's less anxious. But these days I don't really know what to do except running away.

mentalhealth,1id7zlv,I'm having a really hard time,"I'm really not doing well and I feel like my mental health is just getting worse day by day and idk what to do. I've literally no friends and I feel like I'm a terrible person because most of my friendships break up after a year or two and my sister keeps telling me it's not my fault but how is it the I'm the only person who has no friends but the people who fucked me over are doing completely fine. what if I'm the problem and people just keep lying to me to spare my feelings because how is this possible that I'm the one who always lose friends. maybe I'm a little too sensitive and like playing the victim all the time.

for context I had a friend grp in a levels but my so called best friend fucked me over(I had to skip a month of school because of retakes and during that time she got really close with a girl who would talk shit about me and would never take my side when I wasn't around and when I would confront her she would take the other girl's side instead so I dropped her) and due to which I lost that whole friend grp and then in the other friend grp this guy talked down to me and I realised he didn't respect me so I separated myself from that grp. after a levels I only had one friend from a levels due to all this shit and we stayed friends in uni. 

then in uni this one girl in my friend grp would constantly belittle me and make me feel like shit so I decided to distance myself from her and it all just went to shit(you can check my profile for the whole thing).

so now I'm completely friendless and it has got me thinking that something is wrong with me. now for context I've severe depression, anxiety and add (all professionally diagnosed when I was in middle school) and I used to be on prozac but I stopped taking it because it stopped working for me. so currently I'm not on meds and I feel like that's making things worse but I plan on goig to a psychiatrist soon. 

but still the main thing that's been bothering me is that I think I'm a horrible and unlikable person that's why people always fuck me up but in reality I'm the one whose at fault but I've such a huge victim complex that I make myself out to be a victim in every situation even if I'm not. I mean how much can I put on my mental health and at one point I've to admit maybe I'm the problem. 

has anyone else with mental health issues ever been though this and if so how do you tell what's your fault and what isn't? because I feel like the people around me are biased and lying to me.

TL;DR: I keep losing friends and feel like I’m the problem. I have depression, anxiety, and ADD, was on meds but stopped. Planning to see a psychiatrist, but I wonder if I have a victim complex. How do you tell what’s your fault vs. what’s not?

mentalhealth,1id7p7f,"My co-parent is downright insane, and it’s making me lose my mind.","Hey everyone. I have really really been struggling these last couple of weeks and need some advice or for someone to point me in the right direction. 

I am generally an extremely happy person. I live a life full of passions, I eat well, I’m outdoors constantly, and have a lot to be excited for. A lot of the time, I still am this way.

However, a couple of years ago I had an accidental child with a woman I hardly knew. It’s a long story, but she is completely insane. I mean, not cunning, wicked, narcissistic… she’s actually really unintelligent, but just downright delusional sometimes. She’s not always like that. When I’m giving into her demands, she is very friendly. But as soon as I disagree with ANYTHING she says… she punishes me in anyway that she can. I didn’t see my kiddo for 6 months until I finally took her to court because the mom said that “I needed to prove myself” to earn alone time with her.

I’ve been dealing with her since she told me she was pregnant, and honestly I have gotten really good at it. But the last couple of weeks she has been going back to fighting every word I say, she’s restricting my time with my kid by making arbitrary, untrue fights about our court-ordered parenting plan, and ignoring any of my messages regarding FaceTimes or exchanges.

Our court case has been terminated, and I guess the reality of having to go back to court and this continuing on for the next 15 years is REALLY hitting me. I am trying so hard to take deep breaths and pull myself out of it, but I CANNOT stop thinking about how much easier this could all be if I just offed myself. My kid is only 2 and she wouldn’t even remember. For the first time in my life, I am coming up with plans, which is freaking me out. I was out in the woods today and stared at a big oak tree for an hour thinking of how easy it would be for me to throw some rope up and just end all this. The ONLY thing that has kept me going is knowing that if I did that, I would abandon my kid to her mom and I can’t do that to my little one. It’s weird because I am okay, and then all of the sudden I will remember the situation, or how I am not with my kid even though it’s my parenting time, and it is like this massive cloud covers me and everything becomes pointless. All of my passions, all of my values, EVERYTHING I care about just turns into grey and the only thing I can think of is fantasizing about death. I still feel like I am in control enough not to act on these fantasies, but I know enough about suicide that once you actually start making plans, you need to act right away. Well, this is me acting.

mentalhealth,1id0hog,Why does deep loneliness linger?,"
I’ve loved deeply, lost painfully, and admired from a distance. I’ve had friendships that felt unshakable, yet somehow, I still find myself feeling alone. I struggle to open up, even when I know I need to. I want to be understood, to be heard—but something always holds me back.

I’ve seen people lean on others for support, yet I keep my burdens to myself. Maybe it’s fear, maybe it’s habit. But some nights, the weight of unspoken thoughts feels unbearable. Do I push people away without realizing it? Or am I just meant to carry this loneliness alone?

How do you open up when you don’t even know where to start?

I’ve been with her for ~3 years now. I’m noticing a common theme, where I get better, then get worse again over and over. I first began seeing her for an eating disorder. It’s now evolved to just general therapy.

Recently I’ve been struggling with obsessively researching different disorders, to the point where I don’t really know if I’m faking my symptoms or not. I also relapsed in both my bulimia and self harm, and also tried to overdose again. I keep doubting myself and I don’t know if what I’m doing is real or fake.

This started because I was trying to get a job, and have to meet my parents which are two of my triggers. I wanted to feel validated and she did tell me that she thinks my symptoms are real, but also said that I should really try to meet my parents even if it’s just 1-2 days.

I feel crazy even typing this. I know she’s right but I literally can’t bring myself to do anything other than keep obsessively researching. (Not OCD)

I know they mean well and I always take it as a compliment, but I feel so much pressure to be smart and wise like the characters they call me. I play soccer and I love it but My dad puts pressure on me to score goals even though I play goalie. He does it subconsciously to so I can't bring it up without him asking ""what are you talking about?"" He does it because my older sister, who has stopped playing because her knee is bad, used to score 6 goals in one game. He was always so proud of her I fell into the background, but now that she stopped playing, he is focusing on me completely. Because of all this I have been feeling super overwhelmed, closed off, and I stopped hanging out with me friends. My only escape is when I get to go to my group once a week. There is always over 30 people, and I know them all. We play games and have fun for two hours. It is my only escape I get to forget for a little while. I can't tell anyone about this though. Because I feel my problems are not big enough to be a problem. So, I just can't tell anyone about it. However, last night it all finally got to me. I was doing my nighttime routine, and I had a razor. Without thinking I hurt myself. It was only a small cut but after realizing what I did I was horrified.

I got past 2 weeks and I was relatively ok but it still affected me terribly and I failed a class. I just started back and I keep throwing up before class again.

It always occurs when I will be left waiting. For example a friend tells me, that he will call me later the day. I will be waiting internally for that call. And I will keep waiting, but sometimes that call will just not happen. It feels so horrible, I can not even sleep well. I know that might be just due to cultural differences, but it hurts me even physically.

So I really like these people a lot and in real life they have a great impact on me and my life, so I asked them to let me know, if it’s not gonna happen, but they don’t. So I just suffer alone at home. I don’t want to make any drama for them out of this. But I wish they could just let me know. 

A friend from a different culture once told me, that’s just what people say. They will say they call later, to just hung up on you or whatever. But I know, that sometimes these friends mean it sincerely. I just cannot help myself with this.

I would wish, I would not have so extrem reactions. I don’t want to write off whole friendships because of that. But no meditation or journaling has helped me with this. Distraction doesn’t not work as well.

mentalhealth,1id4wuo,What is wrong with me?,"Hoping someone can give me some advice or just their general opinion. I’ve never really felt ‘normal’. I’m a 27 year old female and since I was a child I’ve always been really timid/quiet/nervous. When I was younger it was just brushed off as being ‘shy’ and ‘sensitive’ and I always thought I would grow out of it but if anything I feel like things are getting worse. I’ll just list some of the things I deal with on a daily basis:

1) constantly worrying about what people think of me, I lay in bed at night analysing everything i’ve said and done during the day and how other people would have taken it, I’m always stressing about whether I said anything wrong or if anything I said might have been taken the wrong way and made me sound like a bad person

2) always thinking I’ve done something wrong especially at work, I convince myself that I’ve messed up multiple things and that I’m going to get fired and it causes me so much anxiety

3) I struggle with socialising, making eye contact and just trying to make conversation or small talk. It’s genuinely my worst nightmare. I hate it when people speak to me unless I’m really close with them. I never know what to say and then end up saying something stupid and worrying about it for the rest of the day. I feel so awkward in all conversations and feel like other people notice it too  which makes it worse.

4) when I really have to speak to someone I have to rehearse conversations in my head word for word. When I eventually do speak to them it probably sounds like I’m reading from a script and isn’t natural which is just embarrassing

5) I don’t like doing anything where the attention is going to be on me because it feels so intense and I’ll worry about it for weeks in advance.. especially my birthday 

6) I’m constantly exhausted and I think it’s because my brain is going 100 mph all day. I feel like 90% of my thoughts are just me worrying about things that most people wouldn’t even think about.

These might seem minor to most people but I feel like it is ruining my life and I can’t be the best version of myself.",1,2025-01-29 22:18:17,3,1.0,Early_Confidence5685

mentalhealth,1id4nng,Maybe I have a learning disability?,"
Hi there!

I'm not sure if this hyperventilation is relevant here, but thanks for reading if you do!

Throughout elementary school, I always felt at a disadvantage compared to the others. I constantly felt like everyone was smarter than me. Learning was difficult (especially math and reading comprehension), and fitting in was also a problem, so I always felt like I wasn't good enough.

At the beginning of high school, I developed psychological issues – anorexia and depression – which completely narrowed my thinking, so I couldn’t really focus on studying. I also visited child psychiatry, where the educational psychologist diagnosed me with a reading comprehension disorder and issues with identifying key points. She recommended that I attend learning technique sessions and receive extra time for tasks, but these never happened.

I also did poorly on my high school entrance exam. During high school, my results and motivation were very fluctuating. I took the final exams despite all of the mentioned problems, without advanced exams. Although my grades were around fours, the percentages weren't very strong, but honestly, I wasn’t very focused or ambitious back then.

After graduating, I went to adult education and completed it, but I'm still searching for my path. There might still be a faint hope in me about continuing my studies, as I’m much more open to learning now.

My anorexia later turned into bulimia, which I haven't fully recovered from yet. Additionally, I have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, which further complicates my self-esteem and stability.

I really want to learn more, to understand the world better, but whenever I set a goal (a language exam, further studies), the series of disappointments I’ve gone through comes to mind, and I'm immediately filled with a sense of worthlessness. Plus, I always compare myself to others, which only worsens the situation.

I’m not sure if my problems are just caused by anxiety, or if there is actually an untreated learning disorder that has been hindering me over the years.

Honestly, at this point, I don’t even know how to function properly in everyday life. How can I start from here so that the past and my mental problems don’t paralyze me so much? Would it be worth seeing a specialist (maybe one who deals with people with learning issues or personality disorders), or is there anything else that could help?

Humans evolved because dopamine pushed us to pursue things we needed to survive (not necessarily things we liked).

Today, dopamine is obtained by playing with mobile phones (which is against the natural system because the system is designed to make the body work, move, and move in order to obtain a small amount of dopamine). However, moving just this much and getting dopamine from news, comments, and new things is unnatural.)

So if the body doesn't move, the system will think that we don't have dopamine, but the mind is still consuming dopamine.

It's like the body and mind don't go together.

I decided to go to my gp last year to complain about the symptoms and was told it was just my anxiety. They said that the frequent urination and excessive thirst was because I drank coca cola even though coca cola is a mild diuretic and I was peeing with a full bladder nearly ten times an hour at  worst. I  had blood work done and was tested for just about everything including ANA for autoimmune conditions. Everything was normal except high bilirubin but it's a benign condition called Gilbert Syndrome. The other issue was elevated TSH of 7.5 but she re tested me a couple months later and apparently nothing was wrong?

So flash forward to 2 months ago when Iwent back to my doctor. I begged for an mri of my head because I think i may have IIH/tumour/blood vessel irregularities but she said I won't be able to get an mri because the wait is too long but she said she'll schedule a ct. scan instead. I also got a referral to an endocrinologist from another doctor and he told my gp to schedule appointment ""urgently"".This was nearly 2 months ago and I still haven't heard back about when the ct scan or endocrinoligist appointment will be. 

I think the doctor still believes there is nothing wrong with me and just believes it's all anxiety and I think part of my parents may partly believe this too when I know it's not.

I have a mood stabilizer in my apartment that he approved of for times like this.My whole hiatus I’ve done exceedingly well.I just got ghost by the only friend I had and it’s making me feel unstable.Messing with my sleep and I’m hyper vigilant and just overall not at peace anymore.

I was thinking I could take the mood stabilizer and not tell anyone but that feels wrong.I thought I could take and tell my psychiatrist but then it proves I can’t handle stress which defeats my hiatus. I could also challenge myself like my therapist wants but then it  lets my psychiatrist down. I just wanted to show how well I could do without it and so they can truly assess my diagnosis.on the other hand if I were to take my medication it would also show that I understand that I have to take care of my health and that would show growth and maturity.",1,2025-01-29 21:12:28,7,1.0,Angelshelpme00

But for the past few months I feel so alive and good. I definitely have my days where I’m sad and anxious but I can always convince myself that I am capable enough to make it through just fine. I wake up everyday and that weight of sadness and fear no longer sits on me the minute my eyes open. Instead, I see the sun filter through my window or I am calmed by the soft tapping of the rain. My life is the same as it was back then- my family life is less than ideal and I still miss my cat but I see so much love and beauty in it now. I watch the river that goes by my flat everyday and feel as free as the water that moves through it, unrestrained and powerful, and whilst I’m sad I didn’t appreciate it all then, I am glad I do now.

I have been on lexapro for almost 6 months and the entire time a can’t say if I ever noticed any change. I think maybe  I have become more positive but there is no actual evidence of this. I guess to help give context I am being treated for ptsd, anxiety and depression.  My ex fiancé  was shot standing next to me while somebody tried to get in our apartment and we were trying to keep them out. We were not in a functional relationship but he died in my arms  and it is hard to not feel guilt for not saving him or for it not being me. There are so many complicated emotions. I let this event ruin  so much of my life & there are still parts of me that feel like  I can never get back. I have constant thoughts of death and think out horrible scenarios that I then feel guilty for imagining.I’m going to therapy and this all happened almost 8 years ago in Tulsa. (The episode is on the first 48) I don’t like to watch it and haven’t in a long while. I can’t even remember what season or episode it was.

mentalhealth,1id2gnl,Seeking Guidance and Support for Moving Forward,"I am a 25-year-old man struggling to overcome the severe impact of childhood abuse and neglect. I grew up in an extremely toxic and negative family environment where I was the target of relentless physical, emotional, and verbal abuse by my entire family. As the youngest, I bore the brunt of their frustrations, often enduring physical violence, humiliation, and verbal degradation.

I was subjected to actions such as being beaten, spat on, called demeaning names (e.g., “bitch,” “whore,” “slut,” “weak,” and “feminine”), and even publicly humiliated. For example, my family would throw me outside in only my underwear during winter, exposing me to ridicule from neighbors.

These experiences led me to severe depression and suicidal ideation, including several attempts. On one occasion, I returned home after a failed attempt, covered in blood, hoping for compassion or help, but was instead met with mockery as they ridiculed my inability to even take my own life. Attempts to seek help from teachers were also fruitless, as my claims were dismissed or disbelieved.

The trauma from my upbringing continues to affect me profoundly. I struggle with debilitating low self-confidence, and although I managed to secure good grades to qualify for university, I have dropped out multiple times due to overwhelming feelings of failure and inadequacy. Even before beginning to study, I convince myself that I won’t succeed, which perpetuates a cycle of self-doubt and abandonment of my goals.

I have tried reading self-help books and sought therapy, but so far, these efforts have not led to meaningful progress. My daily life feels consumed by distractions such as video games and unhealthy eating habits, which temporarily numb the pain but leave me feeling stagnant and unfulfilled. I avoid drugs and alcohol because I fear they would only worsen my situation, but I still feel deeply stuck.

Despite my efforts, I cannot shake the feeling that my life is slipping away, and I am unsure how to rebuild myself. The shame of not finishing university compounds my sense of failure, making it harder to find a path forward. I recognize the need for change but feel overwhelmed by where to start or how to heal from the damage caused by my past.

I am seeking advice or resources that could help me break free from this cycle, rebuild my confidence, and rediscover a sense of purpose in life.",1,2025-01-29 20:36:15,0,1.0,After-Salad4297

mentalhealth,1id24jw,"Just ranting and venting about the intentions for self-harming and why people judge. To me it really wasn't a manner of coping although I may very well have used it to cope, but simply the result of being brainwashed to self destruct myself","For me self harm wasn't necessarily a cope, but something integral to my being and personality. Growing up I was indoctrinated to be self-destructive by selfish people (family members) who wanted me to hate myself while they receive the best of the best. They would constantly make me hate myself or destroy myself for their own self preservation and so growing up  it's not hard to see how I was basically the embodiment of self-hate and self-destruction. Being brainwashed like this at a young age it almost felt impossible to get rid of this concept from my personality. Self harm was just one of the many ways I was actively doing to destroy myself. Then with all that said add trauma to this such as physical abuse like getting your jaw punched by your father and almost breaking it, rape, bullying, etc. 

  
I think people who judge others as less then for self harm scars judge because either they have lived comfortably all their lives and can't relate, or think self harm is a form of weakness because it expresses vulnerability  when they are the ones weak and lack courage to be judged and vulnerable. They could also be  jealous that the self harmer gets attention and consideration from other people that they aren't getting for their own sufferings.

mentalhealth,1icwdzw,Do I suck for taking a break from my struggling friend?,"Typically, I avoid giving advice of any kind to people because there's certain things it seems, that no one wants to hear and it's easier to just say nothing, it's one of my fundamental rules in life. 

Unfortunately I broke it last night when a friend (18M) was venting to me (18F) about his toxic relationship with his long-distance girlfriend, and how he knows that he has to break up with her but he can't bring himself to. 

They have all sorts of issues with the leading one being that for the most part, his gf ignores his messages for weeks at a time and he acknowledges that while she's struggling, so is he, and it's putting strain on their relationship because he's the only one reaching out to check on her. Truly, it seemed like the only thing keeping him from initiating the break-up was him second guessing himself. 

I had told him that it could be better to simply take a break and heal separately, and then when they were both in a better mental state, they might be able to get back together. 

Then he told me that the real reason he hadn't done it was because she had threatened to unalive herself if he did. 

In my personal relationships, I've had similar things said to me, and at the time, I took it seriously. But micraciously, when I actually forced a distance between me and those friendships, I would run into them later, and it turns out, nothing came of it. 
I thought that I had learned that the only people who do that are narcissistic, people that's the common trait of people in my past who've done things like that. 

This is what led to my response to my friend. ""Would she really?""

Then he went off on me, telling me that she had tried before they got together and she would if they broke up. This is where I caught myself, realizing I broke my rule. From there I just kinda let him just vent because there wasn't anything I could say or do to make it feel better.

Shortly after, I left, and we both acted like nothing happened. I'd like to continue that trend but for whatever reason, I want to take a break from him, solely because I think he needs some space and him snapping at me hurt. 
I'll respond when he reaches out, whenever that is, and that's when I'll assume things are better. 

Am I doing this for a valid reason? In the future, is there a better way for me to act in a situation like this?",2,2025-01-29 16:30:19,1,1.0,graym00d

mentalhealth,1id1egl,"I might have been raped as a child, but I don't know for sure","I'm a 17 year old male. To just come out and say it, I have blackouts in the earliest parts of my memory at school. It first started when I was four years old. I was called into the principals office, and when I entered an adult told me to drop my pants because they were looking for spider bites. I dropped my pants and bent over. This is where I black out. The next thing I remember I was with my mom in the car heading home. I didn't feel sad or angry, but I felt something. I don't know how to describe it. I could never replicate that feeling. I remember it hurt to sit as well, but I didn't think much of it. Back then, I recognized that I didn't know what happened, and felt confused.

 I was called in often after this, and everytime I would black out till later when I was with mom or dad. I know I didn't act weirdly, atleast not when people could see.

After this, I started having bad dreams. Dreams about adult men on top of children my age (from 4 to 17, my current age). It's always a man and child, and sometimes I was that child. I really don't want to get into details.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I was watching a YouTube video about the horror movie ""funny games"". The man in the video starts talking about the movie and then brings up Georgie junior, a very young child. I don't know why, but I got a terrible sinking feeling when I saw him. I turned the video off, got on chat gpt and asked it if he was raped by those two awful men in the movie. It said he wasn't, but the sinking feeling stuck with me. I then thought of that first blackout when I was 4. I don't know why but it came to me. Then I tried thinking about those blackouts. The more I tried to remember, the more scared I became. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Eventually, I just asked the question outloud. ""Was I raped when I was 4?"" 

I couldn't stop panicking, I kept sobbing, trying to remember what happened. I still don't know. I want to know. I read that it might happen when events became to traumatic for young children. I feel like I'm crazy. I am struggling to sleep. I realized I don't even remember who the principal was or what the room looked like. I can't talk to anyone, because what if I'm wrong and I waste everyone's time and they'll look down on me for it. I just want answers. Either I'm crazy and nothing happened, meaning no one was hurt, or something did happen and my brain stopped me from speaking up, stopping someone else from getting hurt.

I looked through Google. There aren't any stories of teachers or principals being arrested for rape at that school. If it did happen, then it either got someone else hurt, the rapist  stopped at me or the story got buried. Or I'm just not looking hard enough.

Please, if I am wrong, don't hate me. I just want to figure it out. Does anyone know how to bring back blocked or repressed memories?",1,2025-01-29 19:54:04,2,1.0,Illustrious_Mail_211

So I (17F), have been experiencing memory loss for the past few years, and even maybe longer. It started when i was a freshman in highschool and at first, i didnt put much mind into it. Atleast i think i didnt, i dont remember correctly.

I keep forgetting stuff, like when my mom tells me to do something, and after a few seconds i forget what it was. I also often forget what the teacher was saying on my lesson, even if i just walked out of it. At some point, i even forgot my parents' names, and was too embarassed to ask. Even when i was just searching up something, i forget it midway and just stop.
Just yesterday, i suddenly forgot my phone password and spent an hour writing in random stuff, in hopes that it will work. It doesnt happen all of the time, but i think that it still happens too often for it to be normal. 

Im not sure if its important, but i also have little memories from my past. Like, i dont remember around 80% of my past, and even the memories i do are a bit foggy. 

Im pretty sure no one in my family suffered from amnesia, and i think im also too young to have it. I dont stress often so it couldnt be because of it. My mom brushes it off everytime i mention it, saying that ""its because im growing up.""

Is it normal? Is it really because im growing up, or should i do something about it?

I hate what I've done to myself and I don't want anyone to find out what a fucking psycho I am, I'm only 15 I shouldn't know all this stuff I've ruined my brain and even though i have so much friends i feel so alone.

mentalhealth,1id0gdp,Unable to gather myself for interview preparation. Feeling Lost and incapable.,"I did very well throughout my academics. Landed a job at Infosys. The work was boring and salary was low. Hence I left the job.

I planned on taking break for interview preparation for product companies. However I was struck ever since. I tried to learn DSA(failed), Angular (semi failed), react (max covered). I learnt these three over a period of three years(3+ years on break). I am unable to focus on one thing for long. I started doubting myself and my worth. Now I am putting zero efforts. I have no zeal to try for a job. Feeling Lost and a failure.

Read few posts on ADHD but I am not sure whether I have the same. I observed that I take interviews seriously only after my resume is shortlisted. 

My mental health is fucked up due to my ambitious mind. I am headed no where. If anyone faced a similar situation, please connect.

suicidewatch,cz6nfd,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1781,2019-09-03 17:49:51,248,0.99,SQLwitch
suicidewatch,pl9suy,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",712,2021-09-10 02:01:50,43,0.99,SQLwitch

These flashbacks are hell. It feels like its happening again. Everytime I close my eyes it feels like hands on my body. I feel disgusting. I just sit there wanting it all to end. It feels like it's happening again and again and again. 

Medications. Inpatient. A dozen therapists and councellors and psychiatrists and doctors. A whole team to help me. And I'm not any fucking better.

I'm just so exhausted. There's only so much a human can take. I only got out the hospital a week ago. And I think I'm going to try again. It feels more merciful to let me die at this point. I don't want to suffer anymore.

I keep being told to stay strong and it'll get better.. when? My third try of DBT? Round 2 of EMDR? Trying the same things again and again and again isn't going to change a thing.

My pregnancy was awful but he’s amazing. The light of my life. Married to my highschool sweetheart. I quit my job after I got pregnant and I’ve been a SAHM since then. I know that I’m privileged to be here to raise my son. Believe me, that privilege is not lost on me. After I had my son I was put on meds because I definitely had PPD for various reasons, my chronic illness being one of them. It was very active while I was pregnant and post partum which made it even more difficult to heal from my c section. My husband was doting and kind while I was pregnant. We were happy. I swear the day we carried our son out of the hospital that all changed. He left me in the dust in the parking lot, despite having had major surgery. Didn’t help me k to the or see if I was okay. And once we go home he had to go to the ED because his hand was infected. He knew this days before we’re were discharged but him leaving me with a newborn baby freshly out of the hospital was really stressful and didn’t help my PPD. During the next few weeks he never asked how I was feeling, even though I was in excruciating pain. I still kept up with the house, the laundry, all the chores. I popped a few stitches doing laundry and had to go get them fixed. He slept. A lot. When he wasn’t sleeping I felt like he was criticizing how I took care of our son. We were at each other a lot. Then he went back to work. My flare wasn’t under control so it was hard on me mentally and physically. I’m out of my flare now but it’s still hard - if you have a chronic illness you’ll understand. We have times where it’s okay-ish, but he doesn’t help with the house anymore. At all. So I take care of our son, clean the house, do laundry, dishes, take out trash, make all appointments and take child to said appointments. He works to support us, and for that I’m grateful, but he just doesn’t help at home. He “takes care” of our son for a few hours each night before his bed time. Which means hold/play with him while I vacuum, cook and clean up from dinner, clean our son’s room up, and get our son ready for bed. When I’m feeding our son dinner at the dinner table he even goes and turns the tv on and sits on the couch. I wish I could have alone time on the couch just once. I keep telling myself that this is what I wanted. A baby. But it’s changed everything. And now we’re struggling a little financially. I guess it’s my fault. I do enjoy buying things. It’s really the only thing I enjoy besides my son. It gives me something to look forward to when every day feels like Groundhog Day. Our sex life is…sporadic. Maybe once every few weeks. I initiated last night. He said our son wasn’t asleep yet and what if he needed us. Then he turned on the pro bowl. He would rather watch that than be with me. At this point I feel like co-parents. Weekends are stress filled and usually end in me being angry or upset. I’m burnt out. I am unappreciated. I am unhappy. I feel like my son would be better off without me and my husband would see how fucking lucky he is to have someone do every damn thing for him. Did I mention he cheated on me in October of 2022 and I stayed with him. Out of fear I guess. But also I still love him. His infidelity replays in my head every day and I relive the worst day of my life over and over of him telling me. I just don’t wanna do it anymore.

It was very active while I was pregnant and post partum which made it even more difficult to heal from my c section. My husband was doting and kind while I was pregnant. We were happy. I swear the day we carried our son out of the hospital that all changed. He left me in the dust in the parking lot, despite having had major surgery. Didn’t help me k to the or see if I was okay. And once we go home he had to go to the ED because his hand was infected. He knew this days before we’re were discharged but him leaving me with a newborn baby freshly out of the hospital was really stressful and didn’t help my PPD. During the next few weeks he never asked how I was feeling, even though I was in excruciating pain. I still kept up with the house, the laundry, all the chores. I popped a few stitches doing laundry and had to go get them fixed. He slept. A lot. When he wasn’t sleeping I felt like he was criticizing how I took care of our son. We were at each other a lot. Then he went back to work. My flare wasn’t under control so it was hard on me mentally and physically. I’m out of my flare now but it’s still hard - if you have a chronic illness you’ll understand. We have times where it’s okay-ish, but he doesn’t help with the house anymore. At all. So I take care of our son, clean the house, do laundry, dishes, take out trash, make all appointments and take child to said appointments. He works to support us, and for that I’m grateful, but he just doesn’t help at home. He “takes care” of our son for a few hours each night before his bed time. Which means hold/play with him while I vacuum, cook and clean up from dinner, clean our son’s room up, and get our son ready for bed. When I’m feeding our son dinner at the dinner table he even goes and turns the tv on and sits on the couch. I wish I could have alone time on the couch just once. I keep telling myself that this is what I wanted. A baby. But it’s changed everything. And now we’re struggling a little financially. I guess it’s my fault. I do enjoy buying things. It’s really the only thing I enjoy besides my son. It gives me something to look forward to when every day feels like Groundhog Day. Our sex life is…sporadic. Maybe once every few weeks. I initiated last night. He said our son wasn’t asleep yet and what if he needed us. Then he turned on the pro bowl. He would rather watch that than be with me. At this point I feel like co-parents. Weekends are stress filled and usually end in me being angry or upset. I’m burnt out. I am unappreciated. I am unhappy. I feel like my son would be better off without me and my husband would see how fucking lucky he is to have someone do every damn thing for him. Did I mention he cheated on me in October of 2022 and I stayed with him. Out of fear I guess. But also I still love him. His infidelity replays in my head every day and I relive the worst day of my life over and over of him telling me. I just don’t wanna do it anymore. ",4,2025-01-31 22:16:12,0,1.0,OkMedicine3638

suicidewatch,1iekyxp,I feel like death is more peaceful than this life.,"Whenever I feel like dying or think about death, someone always seems to show me kindness, even in small ways. 

For example, a while ago, I was paranoid about dying on the road and kept thinking about how I might die—whether by suicide, like drowning, or in a car accident. Then, as always, something unexpected happened. On the pedestrian lane, people are usually in a rush, where I feel like I almost always die there, but a man stopped other drivers with his arm to let me cross safely. Later, at a convenience store, when I was short by 5 pesos, the woman at the counter gave me the lighter anyway.

It feels like death, or maybe the universe, is mocking me. Reminding me that if I die, I’ll miss out on all the good things in life. If I die, there will be one less person for others to show kindness to, and even in death, I’d have to carry this overwhelming guilt. 

I don't know who to talk to, I'm just scared. I might kms soon.

suicidewatch,1ieqkk0,I have been suicidal for several years and I want to talk about my story,"Hi there guys.

This is going to be a lot of information, but I just want to let my feelings be free. I am not suicidal in this exact moment, however I have made arrangements, written my will and planned my method. What keeps me here right now is my dogs. They're nearing their own end in the next few years, so ultimately, my plan has always been to make sure they complete a life of happiness before I go myself and I feel like I'm just waiting for that time to come.

I am 35, coming up 36. I live a pretty quiet life, keep to myself, very few friends. I'm very much an ""I will fix it for you"" person and I've spent my entire life putting everyone else's needs before my own, showing kindness and being an overall decent human being. For my job, I design and create products that promote happiness and wellbeing. I advocate for disability in the workplace, mental health awareness and I use my business' profits for reforestation projects. I have agoraphobia and I haven't been able to go outside 'whenever I want' for around 7 years now, so my little 'happiness' project is my only purpose. I sit at the computer pretty much day and night.

I will do absolutely anything for anyone and I never want to change my nature because I am grateful to have a kind streak, but I meet so many people who take advantage of this and it places me within a vicious circle of attracting the wrong people, but feeling like I can't tell them no.

If I try to stand up for myself, I'm shut down, even by my own family. The way I've chosen to live is to my own detriment, because I am now conditioned to realise that no matter how much good I place out in the world, I am still (in my mind) the loneliest person on the planet and kindness is not shown to me in return, only exacerbating my intentions to end my existence.

Sadly, much has happened from a young age that has caused deep scars that even therapy cannot heal. From parental abuse, rape, abusive relationships, homelessness, abandonment, sex trafficking, bullying and then there's the health/mental health issues; epilepsy, body dysmorphia, agoraphobia, anxiety disorder, rejection sensitivity. On the outside, I'm smiling and focusing on someone else's problems. On the inside, I'm a complicated ball of string with knots and tangles in every bend.

I think the turning point for me was my current relationship, where I have started to see things in a broader perspective and really consider if there is a place for me here in the future. As it stands, my answer is ""no""... and I simply don't know how to change my own mind anymore.

My partner has not touched me in 1 year and 7 months, we've been together only 2 years. He pecks me on the lips, that's all. He won't cuddle me, he won't be intimate with me, he won't compliment me. He has a billion problems and I fix every single one of them, some extremely serious. He owes me thousands, makes false promises, has hurt me physically a few times, has a drug addiction, doesn't communicate, 'ghosts' me for days/weeks at a time and yet we live together, doesn't contribute and doesn't have the capacity for empathy. And I excuse it all, because I love him, but he neglects me deeply and makes me feel like I am a ghost. I do the opposite to all the advice I'd give anyone else and I cannot break out, no matter how much I try to convince myself.

I am infertile and this was caused by an ex partner cheating and giving me an STI that blocked both of my tubes. After mourning for some years, I decided I want to be a foster parent. However, the abuse from my past is on my medical record despite the fact that my past struggles hold no reflection to how I would be as a carer, so my fostering/adoption applications have been repeatedly declined. I will never have my own children, but better than your own children is the chance to save the life of a child who needs help most. Because of my past that I didn't choose, I will never have this either. I'll never have a family. I'll never sit around a table and talk about how those beautiful children I'm giving a happy life enjoyed their day. To me, this means I'll never have a purpose.

I have my business, but there are other people out there who can create bigger waves than I ever could with my small little mission for kindness. My relationship is just one of a string of abusive partners, I am not strong enough to change my pattern and I will just meet the same type of person again. I'm incapable of being alone, so I can't leave. My confidence has sunk so low and my past has caused so much damage that I know I will never be good enough for someone 'normal'.

I can't imagine ANYONE will have read this far down, and most of what I've written probably seems very trivial to most. But if you have, then thank you. It's all I want.. for someone to just know and hear how I feel, even a stranger.

suicidewatch,1iennm2,Crashing Out,"Brought to you by ChatGPT because I don't have the energy to make this grammatically correct and readable

I feel like my life has no purpose. My family doesn’t seem to care about me. I lost my mom to cancer two years ago when I was 16, and since then, everything has felt like an uphill battle. My brother charges me $450 a month for a closet with no windows, and it feels like he only cares about money, not my well-being. I hate that I had to grow up so fast and take on so many responsibilities without real support.

This past Christmas was another reminder of how one-sided my relationships with my family feel. I spent nearly $900 on gifts, most of which went to my family, but all I received in return was a $30 soldering kit that I’ll never use. It felt like a slap in the face, especially considering how much I contribute to my brother just to have a place to live.

When my mom passed, I expected condolences from extended family, but instead, they went to my half-brother. It hurt deeply, as if my grief didn’t matter.

Months later, I moved in with his fiancée, and she manipulated me into making her my representative payee for my Social Security benefits. She lied to me about not receiving the payments, and I later found out—after moving out due to drama—that she had been taking the money all along. She stole thousands of dollars from me when I was only 17.

Then February came—my first Valentine's Day without my mom—and my half-brother gave gifts to everyone except me. It made me feel even more unwanted.

By April, I met my ex-boyfriend, who deceived me into thinking he cared. He knew about my financial struggles and personal hardships but still chose to cheat on (and use) me. My family knew what I was going through but did nothing to support me. The heartbreak wrecked me—I was calling out of work too often and ended up losing my job. --All I wanted was love and someone to care about me

I reached my lowest point then. I seriously considered ending my life. I even ordered rope off Amazon, but something in me decided not to go through with it. Later, I researched carbon monoxide poisoning and planned to use my fixer-upper car—one my brother convinced me to buy—but the battery was dead. That failure, ironically, might have saved me.

I eventually moved forward, though the pain still lingers. Then I met my current boyfriend. He actually loves and respects me, and for the first time in a long while, I felt truly cared for. Life was going well for several months—I even got a job in September.

Then Christmas came. I gave generously(900), hoping, maybe, to feel a sense of appreciation in return. But when I got home, all I received was that $30 soldering kit from my brother. After everything, it felt like another painful reminder that I don’t matter to my own family.

Afterward, I decided to quit my job because:

1. It wasn’t the specific role I applied for, and I only took it because I desperately needed money after Social Security cut my benefits when I turned 18, thinking I had graduated.


2. The job was overwhelming, and the management was terrible. One of my coworkers told me that in their year and a half working there, over 20 people had quit, citing the same mental health struggles I was experiencing.



Now, I have my Social Security benefits back, but I still need to find another job. Being with my upper-middle-class boyfriend constantly reminds me of how different our lives are. I’ve never had true friends, a loving and supportive family (except for my mom, but she was always bedridden), or the luxury of learning to drive.

Financially, it feels like I keep digging myself into a deeper hole. I feel too mentally unfit to handle life, and part of me holds onto this irrational belief that if I end things, maybe I’ll somehow reincarnate into a better one.

Most days, I stay in bed because my room is so small—my 9-year-old nephew has more space than I do. If I had been born 100 or 200 years ago, I probably wouldn’t have survived childhood due to my asthma. I can’t help but feel that if I had been raised the way my boyfriend was—without constant instability, with access to resources to help my speech impediment, and with a strong support system—I wouldn’t be struggling with so many mental health issues today.

Something I noticed recently is that I keep make subtle jokes about death ie. ""If I'm still around by x time""

Lately, living feels more like a chore than anything else because I feel so alone and a waste of space.",4,2025-01-31 20:55:06,1,0.84,RipCityyx

And do not ask me if I’ve considered accommodations, I have, but I don’t really want to tell the school how I want to fucking kill myself. I don’t even think many people would miss me or even remember I’m gone. I think at best, a coworker or two would go “oh, no,” and feel slightly bad for not talking to me, but they’d silently agree with the reason for my suicide being that literally all I do is bother and disappoint people. Even on my way to my exam, all I could remember was me as a kid, begging my mom to understand I’m trying my best at stuff and for her to yell back at me to try even harder than that. My therapist made me do a new saftey plan with the semester coming up. Feels like even she knew that it’s about time I realize I’m better off in the ground. I sort of like my job, but I basically just get berated and scolded for a living. Like yes im technically a genius as far as IQ goes, yes I’m empathetic and I love people and I’m creative; I probably even have a promising future in writing or linguistics or literature or whatever, but that’s the thing. I’m not helpless at all, it’s that nobody cares to fucking help me. I’d rather be helpless, at least someone would try. Maybe in a few years I’ll think my cat for being the obligation I have to keep going. He’s somehow even dumber than me and would be confused. And he’s already been abandoned once. I love him so much and would never do that to him. 

I know things will be better, but I feel very uncertain that I’ll feel loved. I don’t like that the only reason I have not to try and kill myself again is for OTHER people’s trauma. I’m sure ME giving up MY life would really suck for THEM. Or because I’ll be able to go work for someone else and provide them with such great work. Not because I feel loved. Ugh. I know I should just shut the fuck up and be grateful and I know this is all hypocritical, but fuck, I just sat in an exam crying and repeatedly counting on my fingers to seven because of my OCD. I’m tired of being a fucking abomination. 

And I feel like a bad person for feeling unloved. I have a few close friends. I love them and I know they also love me, but being genuinely loved is incredibly new and it feels unreal. I don’t always believe it deep down, I think I annoy them. 

My uncle Jerry committed suicide when I was two after working himself to the bone, out of obligation, I’m pretty sure.

Continuing to live, I'm a barely functioning loser with no goals who wastes weeks because I get sad. I'm missing all my responsibilities, I have no energy for anything. I'm not happy, I'm just not. I'm tired of how hard I have to try and how much I have to pick myself up and keep going. Being alive as myself is just genuinely embarrassing. If I try and I fail, I'll lose everything this time.

I know it sounds bad, but at least dying would mean doing something, making some sort of decision.

When I look to the future, there's nothing I'll miss out on. There's nothing I want. I can get better and stronger, and it's a lot of hard work for nothing, just to still be the same person, lonely and unhappy and a walking embarrassment but putting out a lot more energy. Or I can carry on like this, accomplish nothing and my life falls apart.

I keep thinking about it. I found a knife in the kitchen that cuts me just by touching the blade. I know how to do it right. I'm better off dead than living a life I can barely keep up with the bare minimum even at my best. But honestly? It feels pointless. Dying feels pointless, living feels pointless, but staying in this in-between feels most pointless of all.

I’m going to be fifteen soon, but I don’t want to be here anymore. I am inferior to everyone else on earth. It would burn anyone’s eyes to even look at a creature like me. I am hideous from head to toe. Every time I look in the mirror, I see someone I can’t bear to be. I avoid cameras, avoid crowds, and wonder if anyone would even notice if I disappeared.

Nobody willingly takes time to know me. I know I am not worthy of anyone’s time, but for once it would be nice to be appreciated. Stepping outside feels like walking into a world I don’t deserve to be part of. Everyone else moves with ease, looking beautiful, confident—everything I am not. 

I also want to break up with my boyfriend. I do not deserve to be loved by someone like him. Sometimes, I say to him “I love you” and feel disgusting afterward. I will never tell him this, but when I look into his eyes I want to cry. Maybe “God” is holding him back from leaving, but he will find love regardless of where his foot rests on the solid surface. Maybe one day he will see that and just vanish.

Lately I've been feeling very depressed. My ADHD symptoms are out of control, I am on the waiting list still for medication, I have a big inbox of emails I have to reply to, I've been relapsing in terms of my moods, I've had the urge to self-harm a lot, and I'm in the middle of exam season and am feeling very stressed. I've wanted to commit for years. Tbh I'm too scared to do it and don't really have a method. I guess it's mostly ideation.

I just feel angry all the time. I feel sad and have a lot of self-loathing. I journal and it improves my mood temporarily but afterwards it goes back to how it was. 

Do you have any suggestions for how I can get through my years-long depression. Any free ideas would be great. I'm on my last straw with life. I'm spent and am very exhausted.

Been unemployed for 8mos due to being rejected multiple times being an undergraduate with a beautiful and understanding wife(not married, just like calling her my wife and not really in favor of the civil marriage thing) with the prettiest daughter I daily roughhouse with. But living the philippines with a f'd up government with a family who used all you resources for their own gain. Its tough. Elder sister literally ruined my life. Highschool up to my college days. She was the one recieving my grandma's money all throughout the period of my education life. She keeps on stealing the funds just because they need it more due to having 2 babies(3 now). I didnt even get a single sorry out of them. Grandma thinks its okay since hence they need it more than I did. So wasnt able to pay off the debt and they still pushed me to enroll at a local college near our location. Grandma's expenses again obviously since she offered. But they did it again when I was about to graduate since again they need it more as their youngest at the time hit their head on a tile placed on a table. So applying to a job is really difficult since companies here wants employees with at least 2 years of college education with a record of grades. But the problem is, they cant release it due to the overflowing debt that they made when I thought they were paying it. And I guess its my fault, i didnt reach out to grandma, never fought back to get the funds back and endangering my daughters future. I just dont know anymore. Fatherless, mother doesnt really care about me emotionally and just want a share of my earnings. Im really sorry if my backstory is confusing.

i’m in so much pain. my family never loved me. he never loved me. i’ll never know what it’s like to be loved. i’m sad about that, but i guess some people are put on this earth to be abused. 

i wanted a baby, but i kept miscarrying. i never even told him about the last baby. he wouldn’t have cared. he never does. my organs are probably all messed up from being trafficked. and even if they weren’t, my heart problems would make pregnancy extremely difficult and dangerous. or so my doctor said.

anyways. i realise now that i’m tired of suffering and i can’t do this anymore. i never want to be beaten or raped ever again, and suicide is the only way to guarantee that. i finally found his gun after weeks of searching. he’s already left for work, and he doesn’t usually get home until 6pm. 

i think i’m going to make a sandwich, eat some ice cream, and then watch my favourite movie. after that, i’ll do it. maybe i’ll write a note, but i think it’ll be pretty obvious why i did it. nobody is going to come to my funeral, so he’ll probably just cremate me and move on. 

it’s kind of sick but it makes me happy to think he’ll have to scrub my blood off the walls instead of me. i hope he feels even a little despair. it’ll be nothing compared to what he put me through, but i want him to suffer at least a little. :p",5,2025-01-31 15:26:41,2,1.0,riritime

I was supposed to start therapy with him and get the paperwork, but a few days later, they texted me saying he declined to treat me. Didn’t even say why. I broke down because I really thought I was finally going to get help and start getting better. I didn’t even know they could just refuse to treat someone. I’m sure he had a reason, but still, making an appointment is hard enough when you’re both depressed and anxious.

They didn’t even give me any kind of document about the diagnosis, just told me I had a depressive episode (?), social anxiety disorder, and either SzPD or StPD. But I don’t even remember exactly what they said—I assumed I’d get it in writing anyway.

Now I have to pay again and book another appointment somewhere else. I’m wondering if I should text the clinic to ask if they can give me my diagnosis in writing so I can show it to the next psychiatrist, but I don’t even know if that’s possible, and I don’t want to look stupid.

And yeah, my next appointment will probably be in two weeks. By then, the new semester will have already started. Fucking great. Honestly it's so fucking hard.

This is one of my first posts ever on reddit so im not sure how to start this. Also english isn't my first language so im sorry if my phrasing is bad or if i'm bad at explaining stuff.

So basically i (15M) have been struggling with depression (yes its diagnosed) for about 2 and a half years by now. I used to go to a therapist weekly back when i got diagnosed, but then stuff went downhill and i tried to kill myself. I was then put into a psych ward for a couple of weeks and once i finally got home, i had nothing. I still have fucking nothing. I mean i do have some fucking shitty anti-depressants that dont do fucking shit, but nothing else. My therapist all of a sudden is too busy to see me somehow??? So basically im completely on my own and have no one to talk to. I dont feel comfortable talking to my family and i have no friends. My depression is getting so bad. Im getting more suicidal as time goes on and i dont know if i can take this for a lot longer. What do i do",4,2025-01-31 18:09:13,0,1.0,NoMaintenance9936

suicidewatch,1iecxrn,"27M Doing the math and figuring out my future prospects, and choosing to opt out","Im a 27 year old guy who has always struggled heavily with neurodivergency and depression, and I'm currently unemployed and very very single. I live in a tiny guest house my parents own, have no degree, almost no friends, and have spent my entire 20s jumping from useless job to useless job trying to find the right fit for me in the world.

I often do the math on what I need to do to ""fix myself"" and become successful and happy, even though at times I feel that opportunity has passed me by because all my peers are married or successful in careers and I am doing nothing. But still, i suck it up and i try to find the way to fix things and turn it around. Do I join a trade? The military? Go back to school and get one of those degrees that supposedly make life so much simpler?

The answer is any of these options for my life just seem as bleak to me as death. A prison. I know this sounds dramatic and lazy for some, but it is unimaginable for me to lock myself in the prison of some data analysis job or electrician apprenticeship or whatever the fuck when it would be so much simpler and quicker to just end it all. I would get the same level of fulfillment from a trade job or a military career or a food service employment as I would rotting in the earth. Im serious as a heart attack, those options are the death of the soul. Trading meaning for monotony and comfort. Im done, time to cash in my chips and head out.

And before you all come to the comments with the usual responses YES I am in therapy YES I go to the gym YES I have tried many many things before. Im not lazy. Im not a pussy. Im not stupid.

suicidewatch,1ieqx40,What is the point of living?,"Throughout my (M21) life, I have never really felt a desire to live. As a child, I lived in fear of what my abusive parents were going to due to me, and at school I never was good at socializing, and it led me to struggle to make friends. I think I was depressed even back then, but I had no way of knowing. As I grew up, I excelled academically, and that was what I clung to for my source of value in life. However, as high school started and classes got a bit more difficult, my grades started to slip. It was not much, just a few of the A's became B's, but that was enough to make me feel completely useless. My parents added on to this, ridiculing and insulting me whenever I returned home with grads that were less then perfect. When it came to take the ACT, I studied a bit, and got a 30/36 on my first attempt. This is good enough to get into the vast majority of colleges and get a good bit of financial aid, but for my parents it was complete disappointment. I got screamed at, told I was worthless and a loser, and would never amount to anything. I believed it. I began attempting to take my life at this point. This was right before Covid, and once that hit my parents were completely paranoid about it. While I believe in taking the necessary precautions, they went overboard. I was not allowed to leave the house for any reason for months, and even asking to go outside would result in me getting yelled at and scolded. School was moved to asynchronous pass/fail assignments, so I really did not interact with anyone for good while. Months went by where my only interactions, were briefs exchanges with my family, or getting yelled at for whatever my parents were mad about that day. I tried to kill myself with basically anything I could get my hands on. I took a box of cherries, and cracked open all the pits to ingest the cyanide. (No noticeable effect) I tried drinking bleach. (Threw up the second it hit my throat) I tried taking an entire bottle of Tylenol. (The next morning I threw profusely for hours until I finally convinced my parents to take me to a doctor). Eventually, I would graduate and go to college out of state. It has been interesting. I have learned a lot, and have found a lot that I do enjoy doing. I even have cut ties with my parents which has been the single best decision of my life. However, I have learned of new stresses like being able to afford food and tuition. I have still suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts. I tried going to therapy, but after about a year, and not seeing improvement, I decided to stop. Now, I am about to start my last semester. I am applying for jobs and looking for things to do after school. I am still feeling suicidal. I do not know why I should live. I look at all the jobs I can apply to, all the places I can move to, and I just think, why? What is the purpose? I'll probably start a job that I do not really care about, barely make enough to pay rent and buy groceries, hopefully buy a car. Then what? The next obvious step is move up the ladder, accrue wealth, try to start a family (doubtful, I have pretty severe trust issues, and have not found a partner in a long time), buy a house. Then retire, and do whatever I want. I don't know, but that just does not sound appealing to me. Nothing does. I cannot think of a single reasonable path for my life to take that I will actually enjoy. I just do not want to live.",1,2025-01-31 23:13:45,1,1.0,The-Last-Eclipse

Anyway coming to main point that my family has in dept of 30,000 USD which is very big amount in my life that I cannot pay the debt and the humiliation my family going through back home and now I’m going back to my country in February (Because I resign from my low pay job and I became jobless now) and I don’t want to leave with this kind of thoughts from my head and the day to day life that I’m living is actually worthless and I don’t have any ambitions whatsoever in my life and even if I try I will not make it in life because of my thinking and mentality that I have so I kindly request someone can help me with the Suicide plan with almost no pain kind of (Heart attack in Sleep) I have little over 2 months time to do it because I need that time to do things I like and meet the people who I love for the last time in my life..

suicidewatch,1iedxfw,The jokes have faded because it doesn't feel like a joke anymore. Its a plan.,"I used to joke about it all the time, especially when stressed or incredibly desperate. 

After nearly 3 years of the most honest and beautiful relationship I've ever had. 

I lied to her about my smoking habits (I tried to quit, went behind her back, and constantly lied for months). She has been sober for over 12 years, and I could guarantee she saw the writing on the walls and could see through my lies, but a part of me thought she would call me on it. 
I lack integrity. We have survived the most challenging conversations up to this point. 
Why didn't I trust our ability to work through it? Why couldn't I give her the respect she deserved after so much she had given me? 

I lied when she asked if I had looked up some girl's Instagram or scrolled down her profile. 
She said “You know the only thing I care about right?”
Me- “honesty.”
Her- “then why won’t you be?”
Me- (silence)


I went into our relationship thinking she deserved more and eventually she would catch on that I was a bum. 

When I’m single and sad I eventually start adventuring to hold off depression but that feeling hasn’t come up yet. It’s normally not this long. 

I saw her at the gym and she couldn’t even look at me, she in fact seemed pissed, and rightfully so. 
I left the gym. 
I am continually wasting amazing people’s time.

I feel like I’m the guy who teaches my partner to aim higher. 

I am more of a burden than a blessing. 

I honestly am holding off because my friend needs to use my house for dog sitting next week and I don’t want them screwed over. 

But otherwise I’ve managed to sell about 20% of my useless stuff, once I can get some furniture out, it’ll be guilt free to know my accounts will be balanced and no one will have to physically go through my stuff.

suicidewatch,1iegq0h,I need someone to see me.,"At least a handful of people who notice this post will be going through a few things similar to my situation, or I hope so.

From being isolated and abandoned in total despair, loneliness, abused and broken for a long, long time with nothing fixed yet... there might also be a few going through something worse right now than most people have ever experienced.

I assure you, If you fall on ANY scale on the spectrum of misery, I am someone who has gone from 1 through 100 and is still alive so you might wanna check this post out just in case there's gonna be something for you here based off of my experience

(*or what I am seeking out help for from whomever are able to provide it*.)

Hello.

I hope you, yes *YOU*, know that what you are going through right now is absolutely terrifying, and no, you don't deserve to be feeling that way for one... more ... second. One more second. And yes, this is not some positive quote supposed to make you feel better for only just a minute nor is this wishful thinking.

One... more... SECOND of that. You might be someone who thinks or feels by yourself or atleast deep down without realising it, that this is how it's always been.... this is how it was always supposed to be like for me. Here comes another completely wrecking and painful situation as always and now I'll be in the middle of it soon.

HELL NO. You DON'T deserve to suffer for one more second. The next second of your pain was always about how some things.... were never done... about your pain when it first started in the first place. How something just never seems to be done.... everytime.

I am sorry if you ever felt this way but It's also NOT only ""your"" burden, and being more aggressive with this next sentence for your sake- it was never meant to just be ""your"" pain at all.... *ever*. There's no way that that is the case.

From what I have gone through, this is the right answer. I hope anyone can find relief in that declaration. I'll be talking about my story next.

But let's also reach out to each other! (if you'd like, however you'd like).

\---

This is where I REALLY really need someone's help, no matter who it comes from... if you can just help me out.

I am someone who has experienced extremely debilitating chronic chest pain for months on end, day after day, so bad you cannot get out of bed to do anything, *just* as a result of abuse, abandonment, emotional neglect, loneliness, trauma, anxiety and stress.

I am a girl, 21 years old, and I also want to say I might be also experiencing something rare.

My hospital visit showed me through X-rays and scans that my heart, lungs and chest are normal and that there is no damage or abnormality in them whatsover. However, I experience extremely, and I mean EXTREME chronic chest pains. So bad that I don't think anyone else has gone through a life like mine.

I am not kidding, I have gone through 13/10 level chronic chest pains, for DAYS on end, in my room, all by myself and alone, absorbing all that by myself, without letting out a scream or any reaction.

I have no one to rely on.

I haven't slept well, or even been able to lie on my bed or rest because of them.

I have completely isolated myself from anyone near me because of extreme abuse, abandonment and neglect.

To summarize - I seem to have NO physical illness or physical abnormalities (I did lose a lot of weight though). From what I have observed for MONTHS and months and possibly even years when it first started, it is *entirely* somatic TRAUMA in the chest area, resulting from abuse, abandonment, emotional neglect, isolation, loneliness and despair.

There seems to be no information online or offline coming CLOSE and nobody going through the same thing as mine. And yes, these chest pains are very very bad, super bad physical pains, it is just that I had to ***choose*** **to live** today or I wouldn't make it this far.

For me, **help** would be - This seems to be a rare case and for a long long time no one else seems to have the same issue as mine, so I would welcome anyone who diagnoses, researches or does anything professionally in any area.

Anyone can provide a similar situation occuring with someone else they know, in the early stages or the late chronic stages, anything. It's chest pains in different forms and variations, in the right, left and middle areas, also spreading through the back, jaw, eyes, head.

Forming **connections, finding similarities, talking it out** in anyway possible would be **as helpful** as above mentioned ways. Whoever you are, I am just a human being who wants to find relief at the end of the day, similar to you.

I am also opening and welcoming in anyone finding other or creative ways to help me out. You can post anything.

Please let me know.",4,2025-01-31 16:02:44,1,0.83,Shelterfrom_company

i have too much trauma to process and I'm too exhausted to do it. 

i dont even know what mental illness I have because the doctors refuse to openly tell me, ive changed over 3 doctors in past 9 years and I'm so exhausted repeating the same story and no one believing me. my parents suck and in stuck in between their arguments as a mediator.

i try to make art but it's all shit and my parents expect me to make it only to earn money.

i dont know what the fuck to do anymore it all feels pointless. everything is happening all at once . i feel like this is just horrible karma from some stupid shit I did like not pick up trash or whatever which fucks me up so much. i dont know

I thought I would be fine but since he’s gone it all went downhill, I started abusing Xanax and alcohol, I stopped eating, sleeping, going out, and gave up all of by hobbies. I just feel so empty and suicidal. Moreover, I was just hired for a civic service (government founded job) but today I learned that because of budget issues they suspended all recruitments.

Do you have any advices? I think simply talking might help me. Last time I called a mental health helpline it was the worst thing ever,  they forced me to go to the hospital even tho I was not intoxicated or anything, I juste needed someone to talk to. And it was horrible.

I'm 27 soon to be 28 years old. When I was around 11 I believe, my mother took me to therapy for my depression. I remember very little of this therapist, but I know it was nothing good. We left that appointment and my mother told me I screamed bloody f-in murder and fought her when she tried to take me back for another appointment. She said it was like nothing she'd seen from me before like I was scared.. Flash forward to high-school, I'm not doing great on my medicine and end up getting recommended to go to behavioral therapy by my school counselor. She hands me a paper to give to mother about it and I have a *complete mental breakdown* upon seeing the care center name on the paper. I tore it up and refused to ever talk to that counselor again. Throughout middle and high-school after that initial therapist appointment,  I was very... sexual I'd say? I was always writing out really smutty, dirty fanfiction type stories to the point my mother's bio mom was getting concerned. She even suggested that a male family member could've done something to me. 

Present time, over the last several years I've been having very inappropriate thoughts that I can't make go away.

tl;dr: subconscious suicide, indirect suicide? I keep walking in front of cars or stop paying attention when I'm driving. Am I okay?

I'm a 31F. I have had problems all my life pretty much with depression/ anxiety/ poor self esteem and confidence leading to some problems with self harm, alcoholism, poor moral decisions but never suicide that i can currently recall (there was some stuff i don't remember due to alcohol). I was very sick for 2 years while trying to get a medical diagnosis and I would make comments about playing in traffic or asking my boss to change the control substance lock box code so I didn't have access to certain drugs. I went through really bad PPD, I left the house several times without telling anyone where I was going, I didn't take my phone or wallet and drove to the mountains and parked the jeep on the edge of a mountain (several times) before getting help.
Recently things at home have been difficult. I'm working with a therapist as well. Medical professionals keep asking me if I'm okay and if there is anything I need to talk about. My family is starting to get worried because I haven't been acting myself- what ever that means. The thing that is concerning me the most is I keep walking in front of cars. One day I accidentally walked in front of 3 different vehicles. Today I stopped looking for traffic when crossing the road, almost hit the ups guy and then proceeded to pull out in front of him. 
WTF is wrong with me. I feel okay, I'm spiraling mentally with some of the problems at home but still taking care of the things i need to for the most part. Everyone is fed, clothed, clean, the house is clean, we have food in the fridge. I'm smiling, singing, reaching goals I've set.

suicidewatch,1ieew8o,"Years and years, still feel like I’m battling a losing fight","I have a dream I wish to achieve and a long term relationship: yet I still can’t fight those thoughts of never being enough. 

Constantly feel like I’m at a crossroads, no matter what path I choose it can never be the right one. I feel so alone despite having someone who loves me. It’s selfish of me, it makes me hate myself even more. 

I always try to spread positivity to anyone I meet, whether it’s a friend or a stranger. I know how awful it is to feel this way, I would never want the same for anyone else. 

Existence seems pointless for myself, like I came to be by mistake. There’s no road for me to take that will lead to anything meaningful. Just a lowly winding path that ends up nowhere, spiralling further into self loathing and my own demise. 

Dreams I hold in my heart, will they ever bring me joy? Do I even deserve to be happy? Am I worthy of being? Despite the acts of kindness or the being there for others, I can’t help but feel it wouldn’t make much of a difference if I wasn’t here in the first place. 

It feels like wishing I wasn’t born rather than wishing to die. But I can’t undo my own existence without dying in the process. These feelings and thoughts of ending it all still haunt me every day, and have done ever since I was a kid. They’ve been quieter at some points, but it’s been so loud in my mind recently. 

Is there any point to find meaning in an existence that feels so meaningless? Do I even deserve to have such a meaning if all I can think of is not being around anymore? I’m trying, it’s just so draining. Emptiness is draining. ",3,2025-01-31 14:35:03,2,1.0,Obvious-Ship-6230

suicidewatch,1ieddsy,I've known I would end things myself eventually. I'm more ready than ever,"I've had depression my whole life. I can't remember not having anxiety. Born into chaos of a high demand religion and being treated like scum for being female , and emotionally immature parents who parentified me at a young age, didn't get me the psychological support i clearly neededand now use me as their retirement fund because they didn't get their shit together financially in their lives.

I've disconnected from the world since before Orange Nazi took office the first time. The world just worse by the day. I devotedly took care of my sister for five years during her cancer battle, only for us to have a falling out 4 months before she died and we never really resolved it. The last thing I ever said was I love you. But we never talked about the horrible things she said ripping me apart for standing up for myself. I was the link between her and my family and she didn't tell them when she took a turn for the worse and treatment failed. She went from being talking and walking around to unresponsive so quickly, none of our family got a proper goodbye. I know that's on her shoulders primarily but it's also my fault. If we hadn't fought, I would have been there to tell my family. I would have been by her side through the scariest and worst part of her disease. But I left her to her POS boyfriend who never cared and just let her decline in health in bed without doing anything to help her. The guilt I feel about abandoning her during the most difficult part of her life is unbearable. All her friends and family know I'm a piece of shit for abandoning her. I can't get everyone to understand the abuse my sister threw out me that lead to our fight. The five years I was at her side, caring, cooking, cleaning for her and her family doesn't matter. Taking her on trips around the world trying to fulfill bucket wishes doesn't matter.  No one is acknowledging that. I've been ostracized because I wasn't there at the end.

There's nothing positive to look to. I'm never going to be able to retire because the boomers have fucked the world and economy for their favor, besides having to support my parents who never took care of their health in addition to not taking care of their finances. My autism and mental health make trying to fit into the world unbearable. I haven't felt physically well in years, even after losing 150+ pounds. I have difficulty with relationships - one of the things my sister screamed at me and mocked me for during our fight. 

Idk. Just seems that the most honest people are ones that are drunk and one's facing their death. Maybe everything my sister said was right.

Every day I'm a step closer to the end. It's the first thing I think of when I wake up. In lying in bed contemplating signing in to work, or swallowing the stockpile of pills I have. If I had a  gun, I would be gone in a matter of days. I would just have to wait for the inevitable sand insurmountable grief and hopelessness to bubble to a crescendo and I could leave.

I don't want to be stopped or feel better. The only ONLY thing that is keeping me here for now is that I don't want my parents to lose a third child. But watching their suffering and knowing I'm fucked for life, is chipping away at my resolve. I have them as beneficiaries to my financials. Their money stress would be gone and they wouldn't have to keep burdening my brothers to survive. Honestly think my dad would be okay with it. He really just likes his sons anyways. He cried harder when their dog was put down last month than he cried for my sister. 

I wake up and my first thought is should I try to make it through the day. What's the point of going to a job that stresses me out, to make money to keep my parents afloat. I have no romantic prospects. I have a humiliating disease with even more humiliating physical consequences. My brain cannot experience joy and I simply don't want to.

We had a common friends group so to make her feel comfortable i distanced myself from all of them. i don't know if that was the right choice or not, throughout 2024 we've been in somewhat contact but towards the end of the year I fell into smoking because of the looking darkness. ever since i completed my first semester in computer science, i had felt so drained of life and everything else inside me. all i wanted was for death to take me, finish it for once and for all. second semester I was so done with life, i stopped talking to everyone, stopped eating or drinking water and stopped going to college, i promised myself I'd try to make a change the next semester but that just turned out worse, i ended up with another episode just at the start of the current semester (4th semester) and january has not been helping. today I have lost all my frnds.

suicidewatch,1iecq8k,I’m just done,"Posting this feels pointless, it’s very likely I will kms after typing all of this out. But maybe someone I know will find this and see it as my “last words”

I’m a 22M, living with parents, unemployed, introvert, youngest of 2 brothers, who has major depressive disorder. I usually just call it depression, but it truly feels what it actually is called. I’m always tired, I have no interest / nothing really interest me, and I pretty much hate everything about myself.  

I’ve been feeling like I’m invisible or that I don’t have a voice anymore for a really long time. For example, when I would talk about something personal in my life to a friend or partner, it always seemed like they didn’t care or they weren’t listening to me. It felt like I could say whatever I wanted and get away with it. Or if I was invited to play a video game or to hang out somewhere, it always felt like I was just a spectator or not even there. 

The only time when people see me or hear me is if they need to use me for their convenience. Like, if they needed advice or someone to talk too, I was always there for them no matter what. But when I needed help or someone to talk too, I get the “yeah that sucks”, “sorry to hear that”, and “it’ll get better”. That’s it, nothing else. What makes it worse is they will proceed to change the subject to something else or to one of their problems. 

Obviously there’s a lot more going on than just what I mentioned above, but it’ll be too long and I don’t have the energy to type an essay about my life that shouldn’t even exist. Just feels pointless. I just want to die. 

I don’t have anything to hold on to anymore,   I’m just in constant pain, anger, and sadness anymore. Ig if u have any questions or want to know more about my dumb life, u can dm me and if I’m still alive I’ll prob respond. ",3,2025-01-31 12:30:47,2,1.0,Several_Quiet8017

suicidewatch,1ie55di,My life is awful but im too scared to do anything about it,"Im 14 years old and i've always hated my life. There's two main reasons to why that is and the first one is my mental state. I have a bunch of mental disorders that have a very big negative impact on my life. High-functionning autism, ADHD, severe anxiety, dyspraxia, chronic tic disorder, the list just goes on and on. On top of that i've also always been very pessimistic about everything and i've always had emotional problems, like pretty extreme mood switches and anger issues. As you can probably imagine, all of that is pretty hard to deal with on a daily basis.

School is and has always been very painful and demanding for me, sitting on a chair, doing nothing, trying to listen to a teacher teaching me something i don't give a single fuck about for 5 hours a day is hell when you're autistic and have an attention deficit. And that's not even close to being all, my dyspraxia is really annoying for school too, my handwriting looks like absolute shit, sometimes i even have trouble reading it myself, and if i write with a pen for more then 2 minutes straight my wrist start hurting a ton.

I have a bunch of tics too that are really annoying for everyone around me. I'm constantly fidgeting with any object i can find around me, sometimes i start randomly whistling for no reason, i always shake my leg when im sitting down, so much, that sometimes, when im eating at the dinner table with my parents, i make the table shake and my mom yells at me to stop. I have really bad anxiety about practically everything. My brain will always find an excuse to be stressed out, anytime i have to do anything that's out of my comfort zone, or even just something that isn't in my daily routine, i get very nervous. I also have pretty bad social anxiety

And to give you an idea of how fucked up my life is, that's only one reason, and the second reason is even worse. Speaking of the second reason, it's all the of the complicated and traumatizing family situations i've been through.

I'm not gonna go into too much into detail here because doing so would involve talking about stuff that's too personnal, but basically, when i was only 2 years old, my mom found out that my dad was cheating on her and she decided to break up with him and move out to live alone with me and my sister. After that the next 4 years were basically just me, my sister and my mom, living alone, in poverty, in a small appartment. But i also still had to see my dad on the weekends, who at the time, was very affected by the break up with my mom, and who was very addicted to alcohol and smoking. He would often yell at me and/or insult me when i did something wrong and he would always neglect me, he never prepared enough food for me to last a whole weekend and he would always just sleep all day, leaving me alone with nothing to do.

After those 4 years, when i was 6 years old, my mom finally found a new boyfriend. That guy is still my step dad today 8 years later, and he brought a lot of stability in our family. We were finally financially stable, and my mom was finally in a healthy relationship, with a guy that was willing to take care of her children. Everything in our family was starting to get better except for my mental health. I was going to therapy, from ages 7-9, to try and treat all the trauma i had from the things i endured during my first years of life but i never fully healed from it. It helped a little, i was certainly doing better after therapy, but the trauma from some of the things i went through as a young child is still something i carry today.

All that to say, that i had an extremely rough and difficult childhood, and i never really enjoyed being alive for a multitude of reasons. That honestly made my life really pathetic and sad. Around when covid started, i started isolating myself more, i completely stopped doing any physical activities, i started doing less and less things, and being less and less productive. I realized that i don't really like to do anything apart from sitting on my ass all day and playing video games, and i realized that i wasn't really good at anything. But i still wasn't doing too bad, i wasn't really suicidal or even depressed yet. That only started recently.   
  
A couple months ago my problems and my trauma really started getting to me. I started getting really depressed, i started getting constantly tired, and i lost all my motivation to do anything productive. Slowly i started to hate my life more and more, and i started to consider killing myself more and more. And that's where it stands today, i feel like I'm a good for nothing, who was just brought into this world to suffer and i want to end my life. Right now i have 2 solutions to this problem, i can either actually go on and try to commit suicide or i can ask my parents for help, ask them to see a therapist. The problem is, i am too terrified to do either of these. I'm too scared that if i ask my mom for help she just wont take it seriously, or i'm scared that i'll end up in a psych ward. And then there's the other option: suicide, but im terrified of that too. Like what if i fail? That would be absolutely fucking horrible. I'm also scared of the physical pain dying would cause me. I just don't know what to do anymore, i don't want to exist and i feel like there's now way to get out of this. Every time i think of my life and how i want to kill myself i start crying and panicking. I just feel really lost.",12,2025-01-31 03:59:36,2,0.94,None

You're a weird asocial schizoid who hasn't spoken to anyone outside of your work or home in a year

You are a downer and a leech on the people around you which is why they left

You are worthless and subpar by every metric. You will never be attractive, smart or valued.

You're too dysfunctional for adult life, you should be able to take care of yourself by 20

You are mentally broken beyond repair, professionals either admit you're above their pay grade or try to gaslight you into believing everything's fine

You seem to only be capable of feeling sadness, anger, anxiety, apathy, and brief manic highs

You have basically no interest or desire for anything, you have free time but you just waste it rotting

You generally feel life sucks and you have nothing to live for, this will never change unless something drastic changes, and it won't

You've been constantly thinking of suicide for 8 years and your death would be a net positive for the world

suicidewatch,1ie8v49,Dear diary...,"

I feel that it's only right for me to address you as such . The idea of a ""suicide note"" seems barbaric and violent . Whereas,  I want this to be a ""vitrine"" into a person who in all his wisdom wasn't able achieve the one thing he always desired ""infinite love"". Infinite love is defined as love that is never ending . To both myself and (buzz lightyear) it means to love to infinity and beyond . Beyond our flaws . beyond our shortcomings , beyond our own human understanding . As Mr Nat King Cole put it."" Love that's made for me and you "".  Or is it ? 

Throughout my 33 years of life my goals of finding this grail of infinite love has eluded me ltime and time again. I find myself holding on to a rope bridge during a hurricane clinging on for dear life . These winds of this hurricane ROAR The three As of love  ""Attention , appreciation and affection"" These treasure troves of love are but a simple myth they tell children to put them to bed .  The reality is there is such thing as love but, there is no such thing as infinity .

TW: talking about death, attempts and psych wards

okay so this is going to be a lot
basically ive come to the realisation im a bad person. i feel guilty yes. but my morals are really strong and i believe things like most bad people deserve to die because death isnt the worst thing you can wish one someone. I think im one of them. 

I dont really want to die. I never did, even with all of my attemps. Im a coward. i cant pull through in what most people believe is the most selfish act you can do out of selfishness due to what i want. im still 17 and in a group home so self isolation wont be possible for me. psych wards traumatized me and they dont let me isolate myself due to them believing its ""unhealthy"" does that count as me being suicidal? 

i genuinely cant tell. I still feel as if i got stuck at 15 feeling as if im faking everything. as if ive never moved on from it. i really do think i should be dead. all i want is the courage the pull through. its all ive wanted for years. what is this feeling. how do i call it and how am i supposed to deal with it. ive done all kinds of therapy like dbt and nothing seems to prepare me for this feeling  

can i fix this? will i even let myself fix this? i dont think i ever really know what im doing. i just hope this ends one day. one way or another",3,2025-01-31 12:26:37,2,1.0,Historical_Salad4185

⚠️TRIGGERING⚠️
-I plan to regularly check this post and I will make my possibly last update on 02/02/2025
-I wrote this all with the idea no one would actually read this. If you do, damn thats a lot and I appreciate your interest in my yapping. If not, I had a safe place to put these thoughts and for that I also give my appreciation.

 It's been years of ""it gets better"". Years of just wanting to cry, scream and disagree with the statement. Always smiling back saying ""eventually or it always does!"" Maybe it's sad but personally it's comforting i knew from the start that it wouldn't.
    Anyways, tonight I have found out more on the method of CB. **Per the rules and my own morals I won't be getting into the details**  I'm not even sure why I'm writing this here other than to at least tell someone or find the words I've looked for since age 12. (Beat, SA'd, abandoned, left to rot in a Teen ""rehabilitation"" facility in the middle of no where till aging out 14-18, etc) 
    I can't tell anyone goodbye in my actual life or they would know something was very wrong. I have masked and ignored my depression for so long now most of everyone I know thinks I finally* got better. I can't look anyone in the face anymore when they ask how I am but I will always say im doing great which is met with such happiness and i guess them being ""proud""? of me. Like i ""finally made it"" and the topic will move on per usual. I cant let them know. I have built it this way. These walls. These lies. This prison. I thought they made me stronger when in reality I just added a basement and kept digging.

I work in a group home for adults. 12 hours 4 nights a week. I love the people I support and my job so I could/would never walk out or do it a night I work. Sunday the 2nd is my next day off. Unless something changes drastically and fast, 02/02/2025 will be the day I will most likely get to know the truth after death. If what I plan to do is considered a ""sin"", I'm ready for the punishment. If what I do is ""understood"" and not deemed punishable by whatever power that be, then so be it and whatever happens after is ideally a kinder, softer existance. If all there is is void/nothingness, that would be fine as well. 

My biggest and only regret in this decision if made, would be leaving my daughter behind. I have never felt the love/guilt I have for her in anything else. I'm 24 and in May I was beat while holding her by her father/my husband. I was granted a 2 year PFA for myself and her along with sole custody during. 
   The regret and personal sadness- leaving her. The logic being she would go to my older brother and his wife. She would grow up in a financially and mentally stable home. Consistent, loving, safe. The bare minimum knowing she would be fully taken care of. Just not by me anymore. 

Thank you if you've gotten to this point reddit strangers, while not necessary for you to do so- the idea someone who has no idea who i am but cared enough to keep reading this is a small positive outlook I do have on humans. The idea that even in our own individual waking hells, we still reach to those we see hurting too. With such little true kindness left in this world, keep doing that please. Goodbye for now.

I miss you so heavily, but I know that I'm the one that fucked everything up. You were my mirror, my muse, my soul. But in time I lost sight of myself, and when I finally came to grips, realized by consequence I had lost you as well. I wish so many things never happened the way they did, but you'll always be the one I have the most regret towards in regards to how things played out. My every moment is haunted by the echo of your name. I see your eyes in the lyrics of songs we used to send each other. Some of them I still can't listen to even though it's been some time now.  I guess that I'm just glad you found your happiness, and I'm sorry it couldn't be me, for whatever my sorry is worth to you. I'll die with you hating me and I guess I just have to live with that, the way that I've been living with it for the past year or two or however long its been. It's hard to tell anymore because it hurts to think about any of it. I wish that things weren't like this between us so badly. I wish I could hear you say my name one more time, feel your embrace in mine.  I love you, despite everything, but I know its unrequieted, and that's okay.

I might have changed a bit as a person, but my anger, stupidity, pride, and mental illness will eventually resurface and prove my character. Prove that this fake empathy is another form of manipulation. I've even tricked myself a bit this time.

 So here I am into this existence, just thinking about how much suffering there exists in the world because people are monsters out of control, and they will do what they want and believe what they want, no problem if someone is in great pain because of it. 

Lol 

I am not anti natalist, I just think some people will never be good parents, and they would be better people if they had enough compassion to not have kids, or to vanish from their children life for good. 

When suffering is caused by others and you know that, yet the only scape from that pain is a mirobolant spiritual transformation that requires great effort for several years, and even then the pain that you have know for most of your life is not guaranteed to be overcame, so its just cope. 

Lol. 

And then you think about how the people that lied to you and caused your pain, are just monsters who dont care. 0/10.. 

What I learned about life : people will be cruel, violent, and you have to grow up and deal with it, either that or you just make it worse. 0/10

Humans have great power of inflicting violence, their desire to get what they want is powerful enough to embrace delusion over truth in name of selfish satisfaction. Its a nightmare, and I see it

Most people are not kind, they will give up being a real one before dealing with harsh truths. They will lie to themselves while destroying others, just for the sake of  their selfishness, their stupid desires realized, and their lifes cursed by karma.

with at all, but when a HSP is forced into a life that’s not a life at all, it’s a lie and my idea of a personal hell, has been abused since childhood by narcissistic parents and still is still forced to live with them, forced into a role and identity that do not reflect me in the slightest. It really takes a toll in one’s mental health after 27 years. I am forced to live in an unpleasant and hostile shithole (third world country). Everything and everyone surrounding me, every aspect of this culture disturbs me and disgusts me to my core. I can’t even bear to hear them speak their language. This place is not my normal. Everyone is so ignorant and backwards. I suffer from severe and debilitating OCD, CPTSD (still mid trauma), intrusive thoughts, and anxiety. I have sought treatment all my life, but therapists and psychiatrists have done more harm than good. People here don’t have a concept of quality of life and well being. They are incapable of understanding me and my unmet needs. Medication doesn’t work because I am not the problem. This place is. I need to live somewhere safe. I need a life of my own. I need to go home. But I can’t do anything to help myself. Of course, there is no institutional help or organisation I can turn to. My mental health is so fragile, and it’s a struggle to even stay alive and conscious, I am
holding on, but it’s all I can do. I live in fear. This place is evil. I feel like I am cursed, all my life I felt so doomed. I have seen too much and it’s still all around me. I just want home and safety. I could have been someone, I could have been myself, had I just been born elsewhere. I am in so much pain, I have always been. But my voice, feelings, needs, and pain are ignored, dismissed, invalidated, and unacknowledged. Of course, that’s what’s expected from people from here. It’s nice that the internet allowed me to connect to people who can see me and validate my feelings.

I have been stuck in hell all my life. Can’t see how or when I will be able to get out of here, and be somewhere safe and where I can breathe and focus on healing and building my life for the first time.

Then, I had a psychotic break and torched everything. I burned bridges with almost everyone I knew and none of my old friends want anything to do with me now. My psychotic break was public (online). Everyone I used to know ignores me now.

I treated people really horribly so I do deserve this. But making new friends will be impossible because i'm a shell of myself now. And anyone who gets to know me past a certain point will find out about my schizophrenia, court-ordered medication, criminal history, and shameful past. 

I went from making $70 an hour to $15. I have the lowliest minimum wage job possible which makes living alone ever again impossible. 

Thanks to my mental illness I have a criminal history that includes 2 stints in the psych ward and 2 in jail... plus crimes that make it impossible to get any job that background checks. 

No one is ever going to want to date me. I posted on ""am i ugly?"" on reddit recently and almost everyone told me I look ugly and like the opposite gender. 

My family hasn't given up on me yet but once they get sick of me i'll literally be on the streets (and already have been before). 

There isn't a way to come back from all of this. My life is actually over.

suicidewatch,1ieczeu,Living but barely.,"I just keep bouncing around from place to place. Luckily I'm a very hirable person whether that's because I'm attractive or have an agreeable personality is up for debate regardless I've never had to worry about a job. But every time I do get a job I lose it within the year. I've had 7 jobs now at 21 I currently work as a barista at Starbucks.

I feel selfish being this close to ending it because it's not like I had a bad draw. I have parents who can financially support me. I was praised throughout all of my formal education for how smart I was. I've had girlfriends and lovers so it's not like I'm destined to be alone.

But there are things that make it all the easier to consider death. I was raped by older men when I was younger. Now that I'm older than these ""men"" when they raped me it's made it hard for me to come to terms with my own masculinity.

For a little background I'm trans (mtf) I've always felt trans but since ""it"" happened so young there's no way to say I was trans before I was sa'd. So it makes me wonder if I'm only trans because I don't want to be a man and more specifically not like those men.

I don't think these are actually my feelings because I do just wish I were a girl. But then thinking about if I had been born a girl just means the men in my youth might've taken even more advantage of me.

Why is my gender so sexually charged? And why is my only relationship with masculinity covered in this sticky tar?

Being a man to me should just be something that is as far away from what I experienced, but I don't even want that. That's just a man who doesn't rape?! That's a low fucking bar.

I've had girlfriends but I don't think I can keep playing the man. It's impossible to be something that makes me feel sick to my stomach. I can't separate my desire for love and intimacy from my perspective of masculinity in a relationship like that. As a man I would have to live with doubting my intentions and being confused about my desires. So any man I become would just be a projection of how I wish men treated me.

Life without testosterone has been a big game changer for me but I keep wondering if my reasons for transitioning are even valid. I've started dating men but that's been almost worse because I'm absolutely terrified of men. Whenever I feel their touch and I'm reminded about how small I am and was even among men. I think about what they want and it's obviously not a puzzle. I'm not even a girl to these men I'm just a girly boy thing they can pump and dump.

I want to save money for my transition but I don't even think this is my biggest problem just two problems rolled up into one (dysphoria and trauma). I have a family history of bipolar mood disorders and adhd. I'm currently addicted to nicotine, self harm, and marijuana mostly to distract myself from my previously mentioned trauma and mood disorders.

At 18 I used to want to die as young as possible fearing masculinizing as I grew older. When I started transitioning at 20 I didn't want to die because I'd be less masculine in the future. Now at 21 I want to die because what if I've just been lying to myself about everything?

It's disgusting really. I must've been a rapist in my previous life because my reaction to it is so sick and twisted. I couldn't love without seeing myself in my assaulters. Now I can't be loved without feeling like I'm there again 10 years ago...

I think this year is going to be it I've been working on a plan and it feels just as real as when I attempted at 18.",0,2025-01-31 12:47:43,1,0.5,OliviaKnudsen

suicidewatch,1ie36ak,"Long post, I just want to know if anyone feels the same <3","Hi everyone,

This is only my second time posting on Reddit... I am a serious lurker but I think I need support right now. I am 24f in the US, and with the way my mental is right now, I don't know what to do or where to go.

Some background: I just graduated university this past spring with a degree in HR. After various internships I have realized that not only do i DESPISE HR work, but I cannot stand office work in general. My entire work history has been very shotty... at this point I have had 10+ jobs where the first couple of months go great, and after some time passes my mental health crashes, and I start calling out frequently, leading to me just straight up quitting. I have been tortured by this pattern of mine, and I have really tried everything for this to not happen. (And please no criticism on this front, I have a very deep hatred for myself for this pattern).

My upbringing has been rocky, at this point I've lived in 18 different places and have had depression and anxiety since the age of 16. I am just tired. Tired of not feeling okay. Tired of not functioning like a human being. Tired of not living in my purpose.

My financials are a mess, I am currently in 8.5k of credit card debt (with 0% apr until spring of 2027 thank god) with about 30k in student loans. Again, please no criticism on this front, I accumulated this debt when I moved in with a past partner who was incredibly abusive and encouraged hyper-consumerism to cope. Despite this I completely understand that it is on me to rectify these mistakes of mine, and understand I need to turn it around in order to have a good financial future.

My problem is that I don't know where to go from here. I do always have so many exciting ideas for myself, the one most prevalent now being going to massage therapy school while getting a personal training license simultaneously. I love fitness (avid gym goer for 2 years now) and I feel like fitness and nutrition is the only thing in my life I am proud of, so leaning into these might be useful. But I definitely have a past of jumping down from career idea to career idea, and I am just so scared that my pattern of quitting and running from my problems will continue. If it does I just can't really see a future for myself on this Earth.

To be fair, I do understand that I should be looking for more help with my mental health. I am going to a therapist right now, but I think I need to look into psychiatry (which I've done in the past), because I think I need more support. I just want to know why my brain is the way that it is, whether I am undiagnosed with something I have never considered... I just see everyone around me, everyone I grew up with being able to work a fulltime job (which I've never even had) and be able to manage that and the other areas of life. I feel like a waste of a human being right now, and am about to quit my current job that I've been incredibly lucky to have been given the opportunity to do, but am failing miserably at.

Right now I am staying at my grandmom's house (after moving in with her after a breakup), and I know how  lucky I am to have her and not have to pay rent. The thing is, she is an EXTREME extrovert and I am an EXTREME introvert, and I don't know how much longer I can do this dynamic. I am a person who has always has the desire to live alone, because I like my space to be private, to not have any social expectations, and be able to do my hobbies without distraction. But it is pretty much impossible with my current finances and work habits to get an apartment, and I feel so trapped because of this.

My mind has been thinking of very extreme (and ultimately concerning) solutions to this recently from living out of my car and traveling across the US (also addressing the wanderlust I've had forever), to doing extreme political activism activities that might end me up in the system.

I just feel so trapped right now. Honestly, I know this is very childish and naive of me to say, but all I really want to do day by day is art and go to the gym and cook good food. But I know I need to be contributing to society if I ever want a shot of living in it.

If you've read up to this point, thank you. Just knowing someone took the time to read my story makes me feel better. If you've been in this place or know of any way I can escape, please let me know. I am holding on by a thread.",6,2025-01-31 02:20:10,2,1.0,TheFakeDelaney

suicidewatch,1iebpy3,"(F19) Ceassing to exist has become so increasingly appealing. Life has left me confused, lonely and heartbroken. Here’s my story:","I’ve been through a lot of trauma in my life that I’ve been able to deal with at a reasonable pace but these past couple of months life has hit like a truck and gvae me years worth of trauma in such little time, can’t take it anymore and don’t know where else to go.

The 9th of September of 2024 I came to Australia to meet my long distance relationship face to face (he’s aussie) and we met the 4th of July of 2023, we’ve been technically in a relationship although he’s broken up with me in very mean ways but of very overwhelming circumstances so we got back in, he was for me during a very important surgery for me and I was there for many domestic violent incidents he’s been through with his ex, custody of the babies of a previous marriage, terminal cancer of which he thankfully recovered after many surgeries, unemployment +stuck with his car due to being broken, unable to pay bills and feed himself so helping out financially, etc.

Well January 2024 he broke up with me bc of his cancer and didn’t heard a single thing of him until around March but I was planning on going on a tourist visa on January to clear things up in person but got rejected, when I finally got approved a visa (a student visa) and I traveled 12000KM on September to Melbourne with the intentions of being his girl and I’m sure he was well aware of that, that day he picked me up at the airport we kissed and maked out a little bit at my share-Airbnb lol and he told me he loved me but didn’t want to say that too fast (when previously having said it during the whole relationship) after that never saw him again until the beginning of January by which at that point I was more than heartbroken considering at the beginning he made this big plan and promises that were then struck by his unemployment, court, his car not working and financial distress so despite my attempts of trying to reach out and help out and making him feel loved and supported he just couldn’t bother to text me more than once a week during a time in which I was going through literal hell.

At the start of that month (January) I had this very bad corneal abrasion that got incredibly infected and lasted a bit over a week, thenext day I had to go to the ER again because I suddenly couldn't walk for around 16 hours and my brain didn't send any signals for my legs to move or walk at all, the day after that I almost went blind in the same eye and everything looked as if I was seeing through very dark and blurry sunglasses plus whatever vision I had left had this yellow coloration and lights had big halos around them. then I got the flu for like two weeks once my eye was almost recovered, then once I got cured and had like two days of feeling relatively healthy I experience all these symptoms around last week where I had kidneys’ pain, shortness of breath improving a bit when head sitting lower than my heart (felt like I just ran a marathon), fatigue, numbness of extremities (tingling and less sensation), insomnia, incredibly dark urine, brain fog, achy joints, bones and muscles, irregular and intense heart palpitations and very intense headache.

Now just recovered from most of those symptoms I developed this huge painful  infection in my tonsils with sacks full of white matter and very painful headaches as well as  muscle, joints and bone pain with stiffness plus kidneys' pain with dark urine despite drinking water and electrolytes adding to that my shortness of breath only improved just enough to move around the house barely making it here plus my eye infection came back on top of that and can’t stop feeling like I’ve got needles poking my eye and they are trying to rule out Epstein-Barr Virus. Add on top of that sexual abuse, not seeing any of the friends I made last year, financial distress from having to pay 3k plus in medical bills, having to find a new place to live in 3 weeks plus looking for a job and a lot of friends having other intentions with me (fucking) when I was very clearly looking for a friendship.

I consider myself incredibly empathatic and someone who gives it all away and sacrifices for the ones she loves even if she finds herself hurt but I find myself trying to justify all of this over and over not to go insane but my heart is so heartbroken at this point that ceassing to exist has become increasingly appealing especially having come across this country all on my own with no family or friends from back home.",2,2025-01-31 11:18:16,1,1.0,horizonseekerspark

suicidewatch,1iebp0d,I need serious help,"So, at the start i'd like to share a bit of my story to let you know me better. I'm a 15 years old trans girl from Poland, not on hrt or anything, my parents know and my class and teachers know too. I've started questioning my gender identity at a brief age of about 11, later, on my 13th birthday i told my parents, who were supportive after a while. My class is very supportive too, i didn't experience anything bad, ever. I've gone to therapy, i'm allowed to start at my 16th birthday, since that's when it's legal in my country. 

I was very confident, my gender dysphoria wasn't that bad just yet, i slightly changed my style, making me look very androgynous, i was really happy about finally being myself. Then puberty hit, i watched my girl best friends growing up in a way which i really dreamed of, i started growing facial hair and my voice got dramatically low, but it was still bearable, i just had a mindset of ""That's fine, i'll be like them one day too, i just need a little bit more time"". I was around 14 at that time, then i started being sad most of the time, i hated everything about myself, that was the worst place i've ever been in my life. My mom started being really worried about me, she thought i developed depression, but my therapist denied that. I also tried the theater club in my school, but they've pretty much welcomed me with a ""we don't have any roles for men right now in our acts"", so i just got sad and quit it immediately.

Then it passed, i started being happy again, i stopped thinking so negatively about myself, i've changed my style drastically, started skating and doing music for myself. I had big plans for my future, i was very happy with my life, so happy that i decided to quit therapy and questioned if i did actually ever experience gender dysphoria. (Now i'm 100% sure i did, and i still do, i did as a younger kid too, just didn't know the name of it). That was october 2024. November was peaceful too, but then it was december and i all of a sudden i felt the same stuff i did a year back, but like 10 times worse. It hadn't stopped since then, in january i was sick and stayed at home for 3 weeks straight, giving me a lot of time to think about stuff. I've cried all night for a few days, because i realised how jealous of my female friends i am, to the point that i just dreamed of being able to look like them, to be like them and to live like them too. I realised i don't want to transition, i don't want to be a part of the trans community at all, i just want to be a girl living her a decent life without the worry of passing or transitioning or whatever, people will never treat me normally. I realised that i'll never be really happy with who i am even on hrt or after i transition. My dysphoria's been much worse than before and i really don't see my future at all, because all my dreams would require me being cis for them to happen. I've recently had lots of suicidal thoughts, but i don't want to hurt my friends or family because i love them so much, but the longer i'm here, the more fucked up i am. I'm not even sure if it's only gender dysphoria or more, but i seriously can't take it anymore, but i'm too scared to take my own life.

I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore. 
I don't even know how to explain this but I feel like I'm looking at hundreds of different possibilities for how my life can play out and I can't see any possibility where I'm enjoying life or thriving.
I mean I look at my life now and I have it easy, everything I could want, live in a house, get food and water, entertainment, books, drawing, computer, literally whatever I would need to just exist happily and yet I don't feel happy at all, If anything I just feel nothing. Any efforts that I make to possibly improve myself or develop in a specific area of my life it's just not fulfilling to me at all, I don't get any joy or satisfaction from it and all the experience is gone in an instant, next thing you know I'm back at square one. My friends are great but I can't tell if I even really care about them or not, which I know that sounds messed up but I mean their personalities oppose mine. To be perfectly honest I feel like I'm trapped with these shitheads just because I dont really talk to anyone else in school. I don't know. Maybe this is all just from some underlying mental bullshit but I'm just tired, I feel so tired of everything. Lot of stuff happened to me when I was younger and I'm a different person now but I look back and wonder if any of that shit matters or if whatever the hell im doing now matters. Back then when those things did happen it was so devastating but now it's like it meant nothing- those experiences that made me who I am don't even matter anymore, might as well not even be me, whoever me is anyway at this point. Every day I just walk around feeling like a husk of a person knowing that I'm just slowly rotting away until something kills me or until my brain just crumbles, Yeah, I don't know.

suicidewatch,1ie85hz,Is it even worth it to keep going?,"TW: mentions of suicidal ideation, self harm, abandonment, death

Just as the title says, I have recently been caught self harming by two of my friends who have taken all my sharps but I’ve still been spiraling, It’s gotten to the point where tomorrow I plan to go to the top of a parking garage on campus and see where fate takes me.

This spiral started because of the election results which has led to many targets towards my identity and my mental state getting even worse based on the events within the US. Now that I’m getting worse again all that fills my head is thoughts along the lines of what if this car hits me, what if I cut off my hand, etc. Once I’m in a location where I can’t immediately hurt myself I’m just left to think that bc I just started college, all the fun ppl I’ve met will graduate before me and I’m gonna be left all alone like I always end up in life so why not just end it now. If I’m not alive I don’t have to deal with the pain of people leaving me for the god knows how many times. This thought process is also applying to the ppl and pets in my life bc I don’t have the best relationship with mortality and many around me have died (10 pets, 3 family members) all over 12 years and I’m scared because my family is only getting older, same with my current pets and I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle the pain of losing them, so why not just end it.

Part of me still wants to live but I see no point in continuing to live nor do I even see any value in myself to show why I should keep going

suicidewatch,1ie7z0m,I don’t really know why I try,"I honestly have said for the longest time I won't kill myself until I've lost weight so I don't need a large coffin and so I don't take up too much space. But no matter how much weight I lose, I can't lose the weight of the world on my shoulders. When it comes crashing down and I have mental breakdowns, I must gather the pieces up and carry on. 


I wish I could disappear without a soul remembering me. The main thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear I’ll hurt someone else. But I don’t think that fear makes much sense, considering me living means I hurt people. If I kill myself, I know everyone will be happier. It gets harder every day to not kill myseld. I have a lovely girlfriend who I don't wanna tell—she wouldn't hesitate to call police if needed. I don't want police. I don't want anything other than permission to ""go"". And maybe that's selfish, but I also find myself unable to care too much about it. I want to be given a nod of approval, that I've suffered enough and I'm allowed off this Earth. That I won't hurt anybody. I don't even think I would but I guess the ""rational"" part of my brain worries about my family and my girlfriend. I consider breaking up with her so she doesn't think it's her fault, because I can't do this. I'm sorry if anyone I know finds this, ever. I know I'm a bad person. I know I'm ""only 16"" and I ""have my whole life ahead of me"" but I don't.. care. I don't want a life ahead of me. I just wanna die, man.

I was hospitalized in early high school because my mom found drafts of goodbye letters when she was snooping in my room. I’ve been on antidepressants on and off since I was 14. I’ve tried every one. Recently as an adult woman I’ve finally come face to face with immense trauma from my adolescence, as I’ve been re-traumatized in adulthood and triggered all of that to come flooding back. I am very much what you would call high-functioning. I excel professionally and creatively, I’m an actor, singer, arts educator, group fitness instructor, and financially independent and highly motivated towards my passions and career goals. On paper I am succeeding in this life. But I’m carrying around so much stress and anxiety that it’s wreaking havoc on my mind and body. I have been diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction as a healthy 28 year old woman who has never had kids, I now understand this is residual sexual trauma literally stored inside of my body. I feel like I’ve been chronically stressed for so many years as a pathological overachiever. I’m constantly trying to overcompensate for how fucking sad and empty I feel on the inside. It is lonely and isolating and although I have struggled with suicidal ideation for much of my life, it’s really getting bad again. As I showered tonight, I just started passively writing my own suicide note in my head. It took me a minute to even realize I was doing it. As though it just came naturally to me. If I died by my own hand, I have no doubt many who love me would be shocked and have the wind knocked out of them, because damn do I hide it well. As an actor, as an anxious and painfully self-aware person, masking it has become second nature. I’m a people pleaser by nature and I teach theatre to children.

suicidewatch,1ieaa18,I Don’t Know Anymore,"I have been battling SI since I was 14, I’m 28 now. 5 years ago I had an attempt that ended with me being at a psychiatric hospital for two weeks. I had been hospitalized just two months prior but I lied my way out saying I’m fine. After i got out of the hospital the second time I burned through so many medications.. antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics. I finally ended up doing ketamine infusions which took away my SI for quite some time.. it gave me my life back. Following ketamine therapy I got on a good medication regiment and I didn’t need an infusion for years. I went almost 3 years without having SI… but now it’s back and it’s worse than before. 

I have been seeing my therapist for over 4 years now and we have been doing EMDR off and on throughout that time. I have done so much work since my previous attempt and I am so upset that I am back here again. I have got a couple infusions over the last 3 months but it didn’t work well with the medication dosages I am on currently. It didn’t pull me from my grave like last time… I am still suicidal and that’s even more heartbreaking. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to hurt the people who care about me so I just keep pushing through hoping it gets better. I had therapy yesterday and I felt hope, I felt like I was really doing well pushing through. But last night something came over me.. I was really high and I went upstairs, put my belt in the door and tried to end it all. First my face began to feel hot, then my head started pounding and I felt a lot of pressure in my eyes and around my mouth, and my ears were ringing. Shortly after my vision started going dark and I felt this wave of calm come over me. My vision was almost completely dark when I grabbed the doorknob, I fell to the side of the door and laid there for a few minutes while my vision twinkling and my head stopped pounding. What the fuck just happened? What am I doing?? I have a suicide note written, and I have friends I would say goodbye to, I have plans to arrange for my dogs to have a good home to go to.

Do I really. I was indecisive, and I was impulsive. And I let literally my whole world, slip, right out of my hands. I had it. The future I always wanted i had it. I have ALWAYS been the issue in every relationship I've ever had, so maybe it's just better that I go away for good.

suicidewatch,1ie6cf0,Tired of being strong,"Hi. I’m just going to get to it. 

I am really tired of having to be strong and hold it together. I am so miserable and sick of telling myself to be patient and just trust the process of life. I’ve never felt this alone.

24F, living with bf of 3 years. Relationship has been increasingly strained and I am not happy, but I cannot afford to get a place on my own. My friends don’t have jobs, and have their own life drama to deal with so they aren’t able to be of much support to me and vice versa. I barely have a relationship with my sibling, we never really got along well in the first place. I haven’t heard from my dad in half a decade at least, and my mom remarried to someone who was even worse and more explosive than him. They kicked me out a few years ago, she wants to pretend like she didn’t and deny it but I spent my whole life appeasing her and I’m sick of it. I have no other family, I am no contact with my parents. 

I spend a lot of time trying to make bf happy, but he will get frustrated when I make mistakes or do things differently than him. It’s been driving me insane, and he does not understand what is wrong with his behavior. I have been trying to stay patient and not get offended when he gets defensive and wants to start arguments with me, but I feel like a very different person than I was before we started dating. I can’t afford rent on my own, and finding roommates in the suburb area is difficult. Moving into the city would mean giving up my job, which is in an industry I love but is notorious for being super competitive and low paying.

I’m a survivor of rape and sexual assault, narcissistic abuse, emotional and physical abuse as a kid and adult. I kept telling myself it’ll get better as a kid to get through it but I can’t seem to get there. 

I am tired of waiting and trying to trust the process. I am tired of the pain and anguish. I just want it to stop. I don’t know what to do. I am tired of working hard for nothing. I just want to be happy but I don’t see a way out. ",2,2025-01-31 05:04:14,0,1.0,idekanymore91

Kennewick sucks, I'd much rather be in a place that isint full of ghetto and makes me go insane every night. 
I'm not even trying to be sexual or like anyone anymore, it's all beyond me, cause I can't even go near somone without them side eyeing me or scrunching their face, everyone, people are dicks, I don't know if it's just me, or something else, like anxiety or intoversy, I try to be a good friend too, I only have one anyway, and were in a long distance friendship, but I know him well, we were ""friends"" since the 4th grade, of you want to even call it that. 
But I'm not even funny anymore, what good could you ever get out of me, I'm just some boring lazy emotionless fat kid who is lost as hell ever could make me, and I'm honestly just mad, why can't I be more? What's stopping me? I know it's me, but how do I get around myself? I'm too lazy to think anyway, I always am, if I had that motivation of importance I'd do something, but I'm literally so below average it's insane, I'm ugly, boring, stupid, uncreative, blank, everything people get Ick after Ick about, why can't I just end it already, seriously, I'm part of gen Z anyway, why not end it now, so what if my parents are sad, they won't care when I'm dead, and it's just them, no one else will give more than a fucking dollars worth of attention, just a short wheep or ooo and they continue on with their blesses selves, their important meaningful selves. 
Im the biggest man baby in this world and you can't convince me otherwise, even if I'm 12 or 13, I still will never be able to get over my eating habits, never again, never ever, I'm sick and tired of all this, all this fatness, all this, ugh. 
My fair share of friends have always left me for stupid reasons, oblivious reasons that I cannot fathom I'd ever do, or things I would say, but at the end of the day...? No one gives a shit, everyone is a sad sack at home or a arrogant prick who is the most blessed, like rich dicks and what not, but I have to show some empathy, even if I or others may not even exist all together, it's tiring to see the ones I cherish every day to fall under pity over my own life, I don't want them to change, I don't want anything to change, I don't want to do anything anymore, I don't want to talk or sing or move, and I don't want them to either, but I am young, and others im friends with are too, and I don't want to be too pushy about anything or say that their life is meaningless, but honestly, it will, what is this? A test? What am I? What do I do? A heart? No way, I'm confused as hell, and the only thing that keeps me alive is... I don't even know dawg. I'm glad for you Andre, if you even begin to read or say this and or... Hear this? I dunno, but he is a great guy, and he brings me joy or sadness or madness every time he says a thing or two, he is a charming smart and capable child, and I don't want to drown him in my shit like I've been drowning others into it all, how, why, can I be serious for a dammed second against my own will? 
I lost him. I lost my dear Sophie. Issac. Those only few who brought the last bits of joy out of me. I'm sick. I'm done. I'm fucking fed up. With my fatass horny self with a body count of 9, oozing with pedophilic thoughts that could get me assasinated. Hopefully. I'm ruined, a lost cause. I have no future and never will, I will amount to nothing, nothing at all. I am worthless. Everything we percive and know is nothing. Even then, I'm just HORRIBLE. DISGUSTING. I'VE SEXUALIZED CHILDREN. DEAR CHILDREN NOT FAR FROM MY OWN. AND I LIKED IT. I WANT IT TO HAPPEN TO ME. I WANT IT ALL. EVERY INCH OF LENGTH OR CLIT THERE IS. I'M TRULY A MONSTER. UGH. HOW COULD I EVEN LIVE AND HAVE SIMPLE RELATIONSHIPS? HOW DOES ANYONE EVEN LOOK AT ME? THINK OF ME?
I want help. Or do i? want to change myself and the past. Or mabye not. But even changing me would never replenish what I've done. KILL ME. I'm sick and TIRED of it all. TIRED. PLEASE. ANYONE OUT THERE WHO CAN HEAR ME PLEASE. I SERIOUSLY CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I'M GOING TO SNAP. I'M EVENTUALLY GOING TO RAPE A KID OR KILL SOMEONE OR CRY INTO DEATH. I HAVE NO CONTROL ANYMORE.

Work on social skills and self isolation even manage to make friends, still feeling lonely and isolated and insecure.

On top of this I'm still dirt poor my inheritance is air. So I'm screwed.

I've turned my life around and went from the fat ugly mean depressed bitch failing most of her classes to better looking comedic best friend on honor roll yet I am still not happy.

suicidewatch,1ie1e4x,Quit my job with no savings or backup plan,"Someone at work that I’ve told my name to at least 20 times, over the 8 months I’ve been at my job, forgot my name again. I just finished the shift and never went back.

Being invisible hurts. My other coworkers have each others numbers saved and consider each other friends, they talk about how much fun they have at the parties they throw, they know each other pretty intimately it seems like. And no one can seem to even remember my name.

It’s not their fault. I don’t make too much effort to stand out. It’s extremely hard to do when your brain overthinks everything that you do.

I think about the way I walk, talk, breathe. I hate being in quiet places with other people because I’m insecure about what noises my body will make. 

I avoid eye contact to a weird degree. I can tell it makes people uncomfortable but I can’t STOP. I can’t STOP averting my eyes. Why can’t I do something as basic as FUCKING LOOK AT PEOPLE?

Advice on the topic doesn’t go much further than “remember no one cares about you as much as you think they do.” I know that, my brain and body don’t, they never will, and I’m trapped with them. I just let them win and avoid socializing at all costs.

It’s like you keep this mantra of shit like “no one’s focused on you,” or “you’re safe, you aren’t in danger,” or “just don’t think about it.” How much longer do I have to repeat this shit before it actually works? Why does it take me days to hype myself up enough to go into the kitchen and make food? 

And more importantly, how will I ever hope to live an okay life if I can’t even do that??? 


I have next to no savings because everything I make goes toward simply surviving for enough time to go back to work to make more money to survive for enough time and go back to w- you get it. So ig I won’t live very long without a job. Oh well, I can’t live through the pain of being excluded from the majority again.


I’m tired of all of it.

There is no point living a life that I can enjoy no part of. Or the only parts that I enjoy are the fantasies I craft in my head when I get high and close my eyes. The fantasies often don’t even involve me, but instead fictional characters (odd detail but I feel it means something). But I always have to open them again and am disappointed by the contrast between real life and what things would make me happy.

I would love having friends, but I hate every aspect of being around people. I don’t want to hate being around people, but I do. And despite knowing that I am in no danger; in every social interaction, my brain and body are screaming at me to run away. How do you form meaningful connections when you can’t even handle 20 second conversation?
I haven’t spoken to a human being in days.

And when I try to put myself out there, my mind will go blank with absolutely nothing to say, people will become uncomfortable around me, flat out ignore me, or turn to their friend and start making fun of me… to my face.

I’m tired of ruminating over all of the mistakes I made. Even the ones I know for a fact don’t matter, I know for a fact no one remembers but me, the memories spring up all throughout my day and I have to feel “cringe.” But that’s not the worst part of it anymore. It’s more knowing that I know these things don’t matter but my brain will torture me with them for the rest of my life, and I have no escape except for sleep or death.

I would love to just sleep all day and escape into my dreams, but that would take money I don’t have unless I decide to fuck off into the middle of the woods, which is not something I’m willing to do.

I was never strong enough, and I’m starting to accept I never will be. Oh well.

I have very good credit. I think I’ll apply for a credit card. The first thing I’ll do is buy a gun. Then I’ll max it out on whatever shit I want, I guess. Idk if it’ll make me feel better, but at least I’ll have a sense of freedom for the final weeks of my life?

suicidewatch,1ie43mj,How to tell my friends I’m struggling when we have lost someone to suicide?,"So I’ve been struggling with being vaguely actively suicidal for the last idk 4 months, previously just passively suicidal for like, my whole life tbh but that’s another ordeal. 2 of my housemates know and I’m planning to tell the others sometime soon. 

But I saw a practitioner today who recommended I tell my other close friends who I hang out with more frequently, (ive also spoken to my housemates who know since and they agree) the only issue is - we lost a friend to suicide may last year, so not even a full year ago. I’m not really sure if it’s a good idea because of that? 

I don’t want to trigger them because it would be quite upsetting and I don’t know if it’s like that much of a risk to worry them in that way. One of these friends spoke to me once about the friend who we’ve lost, he lived with him, and said that he wish he had known that he was struggling at least so he could keep an eye out. But yeah I’m really not sure it’s a good idea. 

Also if I were to do it - how do you even start that conversation??? Like I can’t just be like ‘hey besties guess what! I wanna kill myself’ that’s very not chill. How would be the best way to go about telling them? Being both gentle but getting the message across

suicidewatch,1ie3zhf,I’m transgender. I can’t live like this anymore.,"I can't deny this. I spend every day in pain. Physically? No. My heart hurts. My heart hurts. I don't cry a lot. But I'm wriying this on the verge of tears. This existence—it is so painful. Alone, I feel pain. I go outside, and I see people who are the gender I want to be. 

The solution is settling, one way or another. I will never be a male. It fucking kills me. I will never grow up as a male. I will never be like my brothers. I can feel the pain of living this way or feel a new pain of being kind of what I want, but not quite. I'm never going to have a fully male body. I want to rip my body apart. This pain runs so deep—through my every vein and nerve. I've been through awful things. Nothing hurts like this. I've been raped. I've been abused. I've watched abuse. Nothing hurts like this. Nothing. I would never wish this on anyone. This endless suffering. 

I think there is only one solution. That is suicide. Being a trans man will not bring me what I want. I've looked up the surgeries. I don't mean to sound rude or offensive, but the surgeries are pathetic in comparison to what I want. Who the fuck wants a fake dick?! I hate this. I sound like a pervert. I sound disgusting. God, I hate it. I have scars. I'll draw a million more across my body. But I don't want those scars. I don't want to trade my suffering for the same suffering in a different shade. Not to mention the climate for trans people in the US. 

Even, I want to go by a different name online. But, it's not an option and it's terrifying. I sell and trade with people—they will inevitably find out my real name. If I want to go by a name for real, a whole process. Why is everything a whole process? An expensive, taxing, painful process. A process that will never give me what I most sincerely crave. It's not even a craving. It's a genuine need. God. 

I can't believe after all of the suffering I've been dealt in my life, I have this. This is genuinely the most goddamn painful thing I've felt in my life. It's never going away. I've tried. I used to be okay in public—as if I'd felt like I could be okay with it. But I can't. It's been years. It's only gotten worse. The pain is excruciating. I honestly do not know if things will ever get better for me. There's only one way for me to feel peace. That is suicide. I honestly have nothing left to give. I can't live like this anymore. I don't know what to do. ",2,2025-01-31 02:59:13,9,0.55,youredoingsowell
suicidewatch,1ie14xs,I either kill myself or quit this job,"I work in fast food. I make $13.75 an hour. Every day I come home and crash because I am drained and have no energy left to do anything; not even take care of myself.

They put me on drive thru again today. I had to take orders, I had to make smoothies and coffees at the barista station, AND I had to prep salad dressings. I was overwhelmed and frustrated. The past two days I have been mixing alcohol with my tea and drinking it at work. I think I am autistic.

This week as I requested, they cut my hours down from 40hrs a week to 30. It still feels like too much. I'm at my breaking point and I'm going to hurt myself or have a breakdown at work if things keep going like this. At least that's what it feels like but knowing how things usually go, I'll probably just continue to suffer silently because I don't want to be arrested or go to the mental hospital a FOURTH time.

suicidewatch,1idx6vi,I wrote a little something today.,"I chose life today. 

The thoughts of how fast I could be done with everything, how I could free my wife from her torment, how everything would be better for everyone involved if I were out of the picture. They were hard to ignore. They were hard to fight. Even as a write this, the pain in my chest throttles my breath. Despair is a companion of mine. She knows me so well. The things to say, the buttons to push. Her voice like dark honey, sticking to my very essence, promising me that if only I weren't there, things would be better.

I chose life today. 

I know she's a liar. I know it in my soul. But my broken heart and mind are telling me that she might be right. That once people get over me being gone, their true lives can begin. People needed me so that they could understand that they didn't actually want what they thought they wanted. And now I've served that purpose, I'm no longer needed, and I'm hindering everyone else by continuing to exist. And yet. 

I chose life today. 

Is it out of spite or selfishness, or fear of the unknown that I resist? Is it because I don't want to admit that I'm unlovable, unneeded, unwanted, unworthy? No. Like most things, it's probably the fear of having to live with having failed one more thing, that I couldn't even leave properly. 

So I chose life today. 

I'm not sure why. I'm not even sure it was a conscious decision. And yet, here I am. I chose life today, I'm still here.",6,2025-01-30 21:52:06,0,1.0,Pitiful-Ad-726
suicidewatch,1ie7wls,just really sad and stuck,"my mom committed suicide in 2020. i was 16 years old and ever since then, it feels like i’ve been struggling just to survive every single day. i miss her so much and i don’t know why it had to be her instead of me. 

in the beginning of january, i attempted to overdose on my prescription anti depressant. i knew it wouldn’t kill me - i don’t even know if i really wanted to die - but i was sent to inpatient and let out a week later.

now i’m still here and i’m so confused. it sounds awful but it almost seems like i wasn’t meant to survive it, like i’m lost on where to go now. i’m taking a medical leave of absence from university and don’t know where to go from here. just fuck, man. i’m so sad and so scared.

today i had a major blowout with someone i considered a really close friend over me “trauma dumping” all the time to them and it’s probably been my worse day since being out. i just felt like astonishingly worthless - like i had taken up too much space and just inconvenienced everybody by my suffering. they were really unkind about how they went about telling me too. i’ve been crying on and off all day and it just sucks when you’re questioning not even 3 weeks after you’ve been discharged if you need to go back.

can anyone talk to me in the replies? just feeling really lonely and want some human interaction. i miss my mom like crazy - trying not to end up like her in her honor, it’s just hard. ",1,2025-01-31 06:36:03,2,1.0,Lower_Business_3259

suicidewatch,1ie6br9,nobody ACTUALLY cares about us!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"literally nobody actually fucking cares about us All they do is yap about how life is totally epic sauce and worth living because theyve been a privileged cracker all their life and then they proceed to send you to a psych ward where they abuse you for months on end and inject you with shit until you ultimately lose your mind or lie your ass out of there. i consider myself lucky because i fucked up twice telling a therapist and a counselor that i was suicidal and they sent me to the hospital where they asked me uncomfortable ass questions about whether i have sex or not or some shit like that (im aroace) while i was sitting there scared of out my mind because i wanted to kill myself even more now Until i lied my ass out of there and told them i was doing fucking awesome sauce while they asked me if i was suicidal (definitely not a trap to send me away to the looney bin)

these people do not fucking care about you. they are not your friends. i want to die because i never wanted to live in the first place. i NEVER had a choice whether i wanted to live or not especially with this ugly ass deformed ass body that i might as well rip every organ off this fucking sack of meat until im drowning in my own blood. i hate this fake ass positivity shit where youre not allowed to express a longing for death at ALL because its not epic heckin chonkers or whatever and its the same braindead morons who unironically say unalive and grape. this world is fucking unfair and thats it. i never wanted to be alive and i never had a choice like i said and i dont think it’s unreasonable that id want to die. its not like i can contribute to society anyways because i wont be able to keep a job or do goddamn anything because i physically dont have the energy or anything in me to do it. im glad ive found things that i like in my time here but i am not fucking meant to be alive here. if reincarnation is real then that is most definitely a fate worse than anything you could fucking muster because that would mean losing the little bit of what i had before and completely restarting the fucking moronic cycle of school and work and everything again and i wouldnt even realize it. i dont fucking care about doing any of this shit to conform to societies or the people around me’s expectations because its my body and life and you cannot say a fucking word to me unless youve experienced any sort of actually depravity or suicidal ideation or agony or any of the bullshit ive had to endure in my worthless time here. i will happily break the rules and do whatever i want because that bullshit is made up for a fucking giant rock in space by the racist sagging raisins that run this planet Like be so fucking serious      >_<",1,2025-01-31 05:03:17,0,0.67,throwaway39485747

suicidewatch,1ie61t9,I cheated on my boyfriend of 5 years (19f),"I cheated. I’m not proud of it but I don’t regret it. We were just hanging out with some friends, I thought I was never capable of something like that until we started drinking more. I got closer to our male roommate and the nights just kept getting later, my boyfriend kept getting shittier, and something took over. We ended up moving in with them for some reason.

I’m pretty sure I have BPD, I get MAJORLY obsessed with other people, this has only happened twice since being in a relationship. Last time it was like a month long crush on a coworker in 2023, this has been going on for 7 months now. It started in August just hanging out, we moved in late September, and nothing happened between me and my roommate until early December.

The biggest problem I’m having is the constant recollection of all of it. I think about the things we did relentlessly all day every day, we never fucked, it isn’t like that and that’s the most fucked up part. I kissed him first, which should have never happened, but he kissed me back which is where I knew I was cooked.

I planned on leaving my boyfriend once the lease was up anyways but I just really wish I did this all the right way. He has mental health issues as well, is disrespectful of my belongings, disregards boundaries, and I’ve been so insanely codependent and tied down since I was freshly 14. He is very overbearing, throws and breaks things when he’s angry which I’m now desensitized to. I’m just so tired.

I really do care about him, the roommate, we’ve known each other for around the same amount of time as my relationship but I never really saw him as anything more than my boyfriend’s friend until I really got to know him. He has a horrible reputation and is honestly not that great of a person but something about his soul just completely consumes me. 

Our lease is up at the end of March, which is when I planned on leaving anyways. I’m moving back in with my mom, my boyfriend called me selfish for that and said his dad agrees. Everyone else says I’m doing the right thing. 

My other roommate found out, she’s honestly fucking with roommate 1, they’ve known each other their whole lives and she refuses to be with him but seems like she likes to keep him on a leash. She jokingly calls him her husband and stuff, he’s very done with being played with and I can tell. I heard them fighting about it, I didn’t listen too hard but I know she called me a slimy bitch and will no longer talk to me, say hi when I come home or acknowledge me at all. 

I’m not that sad, I get some guilt sometimes but I really don’t care about it which is why I know I can’t do it anymore. I just need to find a way to forgive myself but I can’t, all I can think about is how beautiful it would be to just not anymore. Nothing ever again, no thoughts, no more being perceived, no more peeling myself out of bed every morning. I hate myself and wish it would just stop. 

I get butterflies and goosebumps when I think about ending it, it sounds so beautiful. My therapist says she loves the way I express myself, and I think leaving would be the greatest art piece I’ve ever created. I wouldn’t be able to fuck anything else up ever again, it would be the last mistake I could ever make.



TLDR: I’m romanticizing any way I could off myself because I’m a cheating piece of garbage who doesn’t deserve to be here.",0,2025-01-31 04:47:59,0,0.5,no-more-anything

suicidewatch,1idyccn,I'm 13 years old and I'm thinking about suicide,"I was born into a religious family, which over time became horrible for me because I realized the unfounded hatred imposed on other religions, so I moved away from it, but without my parents knowing. My atheism has existed since I was nine years old.

I have had signs of autism since I was little, which have never been revised since I showed the signs. I don't know if the religious part implies this, but my parents are extremely negligent. This neglect comes from mental health to physical health. So it was terrible and difficult to talk to my mother about going to a psychiatrist, a psychiatrist she probably won't take me to.

I had a talk with my mom recently about my birth, she said she loved me and I was planned, but that doesn't seem true. A planned child is not neglected, is not forced to live with his or her grandparents until the age of ten, and does not suffer from psychological pain for a long time. So I think about having been a son made just to ""rekindle the marriage"", since my father is an idiot and my mother has no housing stability outside of this marriage.

I could talk about my parents to explain this better... my mother is someone who tries to give everything I need, but she always materializes something in me, just like my father does. I talk to her and she seems to understand me, but there has never been a result, and it makes me feel terrible because I open up completely, and she doesn't help me with any of it. Maybe now I should talk about my father. My father is an unemployed man who is supported by his parents and my mother, but this support is used to support his alcoholism and not to pay for anything at home, for his family. He is addicted to online games. This has always bothered me a lot, because we don't have money to pay for the Internet, so we use my grandparents' internet. The house is next door, so it's here, but the problem is that the Internet only works in my room, where my father spends every day shouting and swearing at people at games. This is really repulsive because I feel like I have no way out, but it also hinders me in every way imaginable and this is an extremely accumulated and misunderstood hurt.

The materialization of my parents is really bad, just as I believe all materialization in anyone is, but I really hate it and no matter how much I said it, it never worked. I should start by talking about clothes and possible autism... I always wore clothes that I hated because my parents chose them. They were tight for my body, the fabric was itchy, they had ridiculous prints that I always hated. My parents never paid attention to it, they never cared if I felt good, or if I felt naked in those clothes. I recently had a conversation with my mother about this, she said she understood me, but she didn't seem to really understand. Her inherent values ​​about wonderful parenting keep her from doing something comfortable for me.

My possible autism is an issue I really think about, and it is in this possible autism that I realize how negligent they are. Last year, I went to three doctors, all three of whom said I might be autistic. The third doctor said that I could have autism, childhood depression, anxiety deficit disorder, and also said that I could manifest paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 15. My parents simply turned a blind eye to it and claim with all their might that I'm not autistic. I'm going to see a psychiatrist recently, so I have minimal hope about that, but it's also making me pessimistic, because autism is the ""focus"" anyway, so if it's non-existent, I won't go to a psychiatrist anymore and will suffer with that.

I almost never had a really present figure, especially when my grandmother died and my grandfather went into depression. My mother works from eight in the morning until seven at night, gets home at eight and goes to sleep at ten. She only sees me for two hours at the end of it all. My father is unemployed, which perhaps should bring us closer by always being free, but no. He doesn't follow what a father should follow, he's not a real good father. My brother and I eat instant noodles every day, not because there's no food, but because he doesn't make any. I've tried making my own food, but no one ever taught me how to do it. I'm close to being anemic because of this, and I'm thinking how much healthier it would be to be anorexic instead of eating instant noodles every day.

I have a big problem with noise, so this made it impossible for me to have dinner with my parents, as the sound of their chewing disgusts me and prevents me from eating. I ate in my room, but recently my father simply decreed that he didn't want that because it wasn't right and it wasn't normal. It's really not normal, but they are negligent. Then there was a day when I accidentally broke a glass and he hit me and forced me to have dinner with them. On those days I really ate very little, almost nothing because I didn't want to hear any noise. I also have a big problem with physical touching, where my dad always tries to play with me like that, which I hate and I've tried to explain it several times.

In all these fights, I was repressed and this created an aura of countless negative emotions about me, but I already had them, so they were only intensified. I recently realized that I would never be happy here. I can't choose my clothes, my haircut because I look like I'm the opposite gender and I can't leave the house either. I really needed a friend or a psychologist to express my ideas. I thought about part-time jobs, as I turn 14 this year, but it will probably be denied by my parents. I wanted to get a part-time job to save up this money and get out of here as quickly as possible, but I'm starting to see that as unrealistic. I'm stable at the moment, but for a short time. I really don't see a way out because it's really so far away. I'm considering taking my life because of this, I feel repressed my whole life and it's not doing me any good. I don't have the discipline to do that at the moment. As much as I'm really uncomfortable, it's not enough, I need something irreversible to push me to suicide.

Forgive me for the wrong paragraphs, periods and commas. I haven't had much ability to think about punctuation and text rules because I'm really bad at it.

suicidewatch,1ie5ful,"Life, suicide and other things","I’m 15 years old, I turned 15 at the end of last year. I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 12, and there is a suspicion that I might have bipolar disorder. From what I’ve seen, it’s not possible to get a confirmed diagnosis of bipolar disorder before turning 18. Anyway, I currently don’t have any friends and never really had any. Most of my life has been spent isolated in my own space.
Throughout last year and up until now, I’ve been abusing some psychiatric medications to numb myself. The effect, obviously, isn’t that strong, but mixing them with alcohol or something similar makes the effect kick in relatively fast.

I’m currently staying at my sister’s place because I was kicked out of my house by my dad. My relationship with him, especially, was never great, but it wasn’t a situation of outright hatred either. He and my mom always worked a lot, so I was home alone since I was around 9. I don’t judge his decision, no one wants a kid using substances in their house. I was trying to get a job so I wouldn’t just be another burden on my sister, but it all ended up being in vain. The full-time school system makes it really difficult. Around here, that’s the only option available, and for me, spending the whole day at school while also trying to work is impossible. But I know dropping out wouldn’t be well accepted.

I struggle with self-harm and other issues, but that’s a common pattern. The last few weeks, since I left home, have been quite chaotic, but I barely have time to actually think about it. Apparently, my mom wanted me to come back home, but the situation there is a bit complicated.
I’ve been through proper psychological treatment before, but it never really worked. It was always something weak or ineffective, probably because of the chaotic environment.
A few months ago, I used to play guitar and keyboard, I think I mentioned this somewhere on the forum, but it lost its spark. It became a constant source of stress, and I just don’t feel motivated to play anymore. Everything I ever wanted to experience or set as a goal before dying has already been accomplished. They were never big things, just the feeling of truly living, or at least what I thought that was when I was younger.
Two days ago, I tried to kill myself using quetiapine, the dumbest way possible. In the end, I just passed out and ended up screwing myself over. Anyway, I don’t really plan on staying alive until the end of the year, but I’ll try to hold on as long as I can.

I have also struggled with Depression and Suicidal thoughts almost all my life and it sound ridicoulous but this rotten tooth is what will maybe push me over the edge. The thought of having it fixed from a dentist terrifys me, i dont even know why i never really had any bad expirences with a dentist but when i think about all i fell is panic and terror. Whenever i try to think about how i could approach the problem the only result is that i start to disassociate and slowly sink into suicidal ideation. I couldnt get myself to really tell anyone about any of this cause the thought of someone trying to help me sounds so stressfull.

i dont really know what to do so i ask you kind people of reddit but i will probably delete at somepoint",8,2025-01-30 16:35:55,4,0.9,Duck_Lover_3

suicidewatch,1ie4ycr,Yea idk,"Every day the pain gets worse and worse. I feel like my head is going to explode sometimes. But I mean it could be worse. I don’t really know why I’m writing this down, I guess all the times people have told me to write down how I feel has gotten to me. It’s just weird because for me to write how I feel the only words I could use to express it is… nothing I sat and looked at my screen for at least a minute and couldn’t think of the word. Honestly I’m holding myself back scared someone will see how vulnerable I am. The truth is I’m scared but I’m a man and a father. But this world is so cruel, I’m cruel, everyone we know and love is cruel or will be. So what’s the point, why do we act as if we’re good and live morally right, everyone should embrace that chaos. But really that thought process is being weak. But nothing will change, people will continue to suffer, I’ll continue to suffer. We say find happiness in life but there isn’t any for me. All happiness revolves around ones desires. So what? I’ll be happy when what. The people that I want to hurt back get hurt? When I have a beautiful loyal woman that satisfies my sexual needs? Or would it be the nice cars, clothes, jewelry or will it be drugs. I just hate this. Any way I feel is irrelevant because I brought a child into this world. She doesn’t deserve a father that is searching for happiness in all the wrong places. I don’t know how but ill become the man that she deserves.

 

In 2022 I almost killed myself fr, I mean I tried plenty of times, taking a bunch of pills with liquor, only to wake up upset because I’m still here and wasted that money. But there was this one night I had a gun, was aiming at myself over and over. Sorta fetishizing the idea of killing myself as if I needed to. Not even because I was upset or something went wrong. It was sort of a version of me that is always me in all my life. That person was the true me. Now I think to myself over and over what if I did. I wish I did. But its too late I need to take care of my responsibilities. But now I live in a sort of fantasy world in which I did do it. Everything would be silent, I wouldn’t have back pain, I wouldn’t have to have my head. I hate myself I hate just myself.. nothing else, no one else, because I could’ve died, guilt free, and finally be to rest. But its not a option. Maybe I need to grow up, maybe there’s something wrong with my head, maybe how I think and feel isn’t so relatable and I do have issues. I mean I do have issues, but I think I was born this way, I’ve always been a bad person, even before I knew better I should’ve known better than to make choices I did. It seems like ill never learn, I’m scared I don’t want to go to prison, I don’t want to die, but there’s something wrong with me. I don’t think I can be fixed or saved. Im just like the people I feel like shouldn’t be alive in this world.",1,2025-01-31 03:49:07,0,1.0,Ecstatic_Pace6862

Only thing is I have a wife and 4 yo girl.   Thinking about how I can provide for them.   If I delete myself before I’m officially fired they can get my life insurance (there’s no suicide clause).  But I would have to do it before next Friday and tbh I’m not sure I’m ready to go just yet… I want to spend time with my lil girl as much as possible.   Option 2 would give me more time… I’ll wait until I have no choice to avoid possible prison time due to my court case.  However, no insurance payout later, just whatever I have in retirement which isn’t much.

Then of course later on we’re talking and she tells me I’m not trying hard enough to stop being depressed and anxious lol. Then she further says she doesn’t want to be friends anymore because I stress her out and overwhelm her.

suicidewatch,1idz3ea,Daily thoughts,"I don’t want anyone to lose hope because of my post, as every brain injury and support system is unique. I appear to be an exception in the TBI community because my symptoms manifested much later.

In 2014, I was involved in a car accident that caused me to lose consciousness. After three months, I managed to return to work full-time and high school, eventually graduating. I sustained a few broken ribs, but the traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most significant injury I received.

However, in late 2020 or early 2021, my condition suddenly deteriorated. I vividly remember the day my condition changed. I experienced severe brain fatigue, paranoia, anxiety, and ADHD (which I had previously been diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, but both symptoms had worsened). These symptoms had all significantly worsened. As a result, I became increasingly isolated and had to be hospitalized (voluntarily committed) multiple times.

I consulted a psychiatrist, who prescribed a variety of medications and none touched me even at times made things worse.

I’m still undecided about pursuing disability benefits because I was hopeful that I could recover. I continued working while undergoing medication changes and other adjustments, but eventually, I was unable to maintain my previous level of productivity. I’m now on Medicaid and looking to apply for disability benefits as I fear I have no other choice.

Currently, I take lorazepam for panic attacks, and that’s all the medication I’m prescribed. I haven’t seen a neuropsychologist or anything similar in neurology, who believes that my condition is purely psychological and suggests that I see a psychiatrist, which I’ve been doing since the onset of my symptoms.

The support I receive is quite limited, as I require significant assistance. Since advocating for myself, I’m considering placing myself in a group home, as it seems like a better option than ending my life. Just seeing other options out there… my recent scans have shown brain atrophy as well as microhemorrhages on the brain. The daily fatigue, depression, and heightened anxiety have made it the most difficult. These changes occurred at age 25, and I was hit at age 17.

Is there anything that would help me out? please don't tell me ""go to a therapist"" trust me, my parents did but decided to stop making me go out of nowhere, or praying to God because I already lost faith.

suicidewatch,1ie2nhi,My 12 year old sister has been harming herself and I’m not sure what to do.,"
TW - self harm, thoughts of suicide

For context I’m 21 and she’s 13, recently I discovered that she has feelings of depression and thinks suicidal thoughts. She didn’t tell me this, I had to ask her. She hasn’t told our parents but I spoke to one of them about it, as I don’t know how to deal with this alone, however I told them not to tell her I told them.

Basically, last year she joined high school for the first time and she got her very first phone, because she also goes to and from school by herself sometimes. I found out by seeing a notification on her phone that she was being bullied, sometime around the middle of last year. These girls were from her primary school and they would fat shame her and they would pull her dress up and steal money from her and her friends. We spoke with the school about it and she stopped being friends with them and found new friends, so we thought that was that dealt with. Now her new friend, let’s call her A, A joined the school halfway through the year from a different school. My sister and A became good friends and still are. I don’t ever want to judge anyone but as a 12 year old when she first visited our house, she was wearing very revealing clothing, and on her instagram it’s always pictures showing off her body or revealing clothes. It’s not my place to judge on what another girl wears, however I do want to look out for my little sister. 

Recently, she’s stopped eating as much as she used to, so I asked if she was okay and she told me that she has an eating disorder and she’s been throwing up her food. I don’t want to invalidate her feelings or what she’s telling me, but this all happened in one day basically, she was eating fine the day before and now she’s barely eating 2 meals a day, and not even full meals. She’s not skinny, but she’s not obese either. I told her if she wants to be healthier I can show her how to do it healthily, through exercise and eating healthy. I told her how throwing up often is bad for your insides and bad for your teeth. She said she doesn’t want to do it the healthy way. She also told me she hurts herself to avoid thinking about suicide, when I saw the cuts they were all quite superficial, not deep at all.

Now let me talk about A. A has a lot of issues and I sincerely hope she gets better, however it is not another 12 year olds responsibility to take care of her. According to my sister, A has been admitted to a psych hospital in the past, she cuts herself, she’s attempted suicide and overdosing too. While my family was on holidays a few weeks ago, A messages my sister saying that she took too much paracetamol and overdosed. She was fine. 

I know my sister well. I know that she didn’t even know what overdosing was until she met A. I am not invalidating her feelings, I was depressed once too, but I know her and all of this has been influenced by someone else.

Onto present day, I’ve convinced my parents to change her school so that she can have a better environment. My sister keeps saying she doesn’t want to and that she wants to keep her current friends. I told her even if she wants to keep her friends, staying in the same school as bullies is not healthy. So we’ve done a few enrolment interviews, and I asked her if today she would wear her school dress normally so she can look presentable for the interview, normally she wears full sleeves and leggings under her dress even though it’s 30 degrees celsius. When she got out of the shower I saw that she had new cuts, on the day she was supposed to wear her dress without full sleeves underneath. I asked her why and she said I don’t know. I told her honestly that It’s not healthy for you to try to get better and keep listening to someone else’s suicidal thoughts. She told me that A is a good friend and that because she’s going to school without full sleeves, A is too to show solidarity. Mind you, my sister has no noticeable scars until she cut herself again yesterday. I asked if A had scars and she said A has a lot. So basically A is doing this in “solidarity” of my sister. I have a feeling my sister cut herself because she wanted to have scars as well, so that A wasn’t doing it for no reason. 

This is where I don’t know what to do. Should we keep trying to change her school? Or should we let her stay? I’m also trying to get her in to see a therapist, however it’s a couple months wait. The new school we want to move her too also has much better facilities and opportunities than her current school. I know this is long but I don’t know how else to word it.",1,2025-01-31 01:54:30,0,1.0,livingreppingxo

I even offered to pay for it myself but she wont listen to me, for him he's just fucking lollydaddling stalling time and most likely wont actually help me. If he somehow does, then that would be a miracle for history books. 

And if I wait till I'm 18 to pull them the tooth/teeth might have screwed my mouth over by then, and I probably wont be able to afford it as they may not let me use the insurance, plus having to use my savings to find a place to live until it runs out vs if I use my savings now while I live with them I kind of have a buffer I suppose. Anybody know of a way to get healthcare without parent consent in the U.S? 

 Was I a genocidal dictator in my past life or what? What is this nonsense? I just hope my method works when the time comes. I truly, really tried so hard to try and make my existence enjoyable but they snuff out every tiny flame I manage to light. I have no motivation or will to live and Im so damn tired. Im just really, really, freaking tired of trying.

If it doesnt work I guess I'll try and find somebody to sell me drugs & alcohol then just shove it down my throat and hope it kills me. If that doesn't work and Im not too fucked up from the attampt, guess I'll commit dumb petty crimes so atleast I can have a place for shelter.

suicidewatch,1ido5g0,How life is as a man.,"As a man I've learned woman only care about what you can provide for their lives instead of who you are as a person. Just in my experiences. I'm not saying all woman are like that. I've given my everything to every partner. Just to get discarded. Just to help them through this hardest points in life and be left alone when they are in a better place. I've never had someone not give up on me. I've let people walk all over me..do and say whatever they want. Still I'm the one who gets left or cheated on. I can give people everything they ask for. I can be their ""dream spouse"" yet somehow end up second to someone they randomly meet. I want to cry but I know I'm not supposed to. As a man I'm supposed to have unconditional love for everyone. I'm supposed to be the person every can rely on. Yet I have no one to rely on. 

I don't want to spend my life alone. I also can't seem to not get discarded. I'm not supposed to show any emotion. I'm just supposed to go to work like everything is fine. Like I'm not dying inside. Like I don't have this pain that never goes away... i have a good job but there's not respect for a man if they're not paid. Then when you say anything it's taken as complaining. Then you grab a bottle and can't ask for help. You keep trying to pull yourself out of the hole that you were put in rather it was your fault or not. Then learn you have to get out of that hole yourself too. There's a reason so many men are depressed. Everything we can't express because it's a sign of weakness. 

I don't expect anyone to understand. Don't even know why I'm writing this. I guess as a way to vent. As a man they don't know what you're worth until the day that you die. Then when you die they move onto another man to confide in.

suicidewatch,1idswy3,No one will ever love me,"I feel so inferior to everyone, my brain doesn’t allow me to feel loved or secure. I got in a fight with my best friend yesterday because he started following his ex best friend again and I hate myself so much for it, he only did that because I “hung out” (I had to go to hospital to get checked up for something and I asked him to come with me first since he only lives a 5 min walk away and he didn’t want to) with my friend that he doesn’t like and he knows I did that purposefully but I had no one else to go with and he was annoyed because I keep on purposely hanging out with people to get him mad. But I don’t know how else I’m supposed to cope ? He started following his ex best friend again because back when she first messaged him an apology he ignored it because he had me but when I hung out with my friend he wanted to know what she was going to say and the fact that she’s already back to being friends with all his other friends  was hard for him. And I’m so mad that he doesn’t have a back bone, she stopped being his friend over her then at the time boyfriend (who might’ve been abusive and controlling) and I get that but this isn’t the first time she’s stopped being his friend over a guy and she’s clearly not over her ex and will do this again to him and it’s so frustrating. I’m so terrified he will talk to her again and realise i was just a filler how useless I am to him now that he’s friends with her again, I hate every single second he is still following her. They’ve known each other for longer and have been friends since they were like 8 and it just sucks. It just sucks that no one will ever prioritise me, I asked him who he prefers more me or her and he said he won’t answer that question and I know it’s because it’s her he prefers. I’m so tired of always being just a filler, never being anyone’s priority, never being able to be loved. And it’s not even that no one loves me it’s just the way my brain works, it’s either all or nothing, I can’t fix it and he tells me to get help and that none of it is his fault and he can’t do anything about how I feel because I need to see a therapist but won’t. I’m so angry because I’m trying so hard but everyday is such a struggle, I feel so defeated and I already feel like I’ve ruined my life, I don’t think I will ever be happy as long as I live because my brain is so fucked. I just want to truly be happy but will killing myself even give that? It’d give me the satisfaction that maybe my best friend would be sad over it and possibly blame himself and that’s enough of a reason. I just want the memory of me to haunt him for the rest of his life I never want him to forget what he caused- I know it’s irrational and wrong but what else do I do. I don’t care about anybody else in my life other than him and so it’s pointless now. I don’t know how I’ll do it because I hate pain but I will, I want it to be peaceful and serene but it’s most likely will have to be stabbing myself because I have no other means.

suicidewatch,1idsrgw,I have kids. Is it a bad idea to live with a partner who struggles with suicidal ideation?,"My partner and I have talked for over a year about the possibility of living together to help each other carry the weight of life. I long for that level of partnership and companionship. I want to be their support person in a more day-to-day way. They are not sure if it's a good idea.

One of the reasons they don't know if it's a good idea is that I have three kids (my kids love my partner and I think they would only benefit from having my partner in their lives). But, my partner gets sucked pretty deep into the darkness sometimes. I would say mild, to moderate suicidal ideation. No plans or actions taken. They are concerned that it is a bad idea to live together and form deeper bonds with my kids while this is still a struggle for them. They are terrified of doing lasting harm to my kids if they actually follow through with the ideation someday.

My first response is to not let that stop us from partnering together and living together. My risk tolerance is higher that theirs in this. But, I'm concerned that I'm not taking this seriously enough.

Everyone is struggling. Everyone has their issues. How do you determine if someone's issues are a deal breaker for something like living together? I don't think I can expect my partner to suddenly ""get over"" this. This might be something they struggle with for their entire life. If it were just me, I would take that risk everyday of the week. But, I also need to consider my kids.

I don't know how to think about this. I don't know how to determine what the ""right"" answer is here. I don't even know if I fully understand the decision I would be making... the risk my kids and I would be taking.

suicidewatch,1ie104f,I’m 22 and my life is over.,"I’m 22, a mother to a beautiful newborn baby, and I want to end my life. “It’s just postpartum” “you’ll get through it, talk to your doctor!” No. I’m sorry, but no. I’m 22. I graduated high school early, have a handful of college semesters, 49 state and federal licenses, IRA, CDs and trust for my daughter, a bank account balance some would think is impossible at my age, 2 owned properties and about to secure another, several cars and many many other luxury items. I get to not work for a long time, even if I ever want to return. So does the father of my child all because of what I have and did. Alternatively, I feel like I have nothing. I have no friends, no family (not really an exaggeration as I have my boyfriend and my baby) but no real or reliable social circle. No community. I’m too invested in my feeling of being alone, I have a horrible life. I know Reddit is known to question the truth in people’s posts, but I assure you all my story is truth and I have the receipts. I have this probably unhealthy jealousy of my partner. Not only him, but other people. Specifically though, he’s amazing. He’s great. He’s everything I can’t be and everything I want to be. He has a large group of friends, dating back to his elementary days. He has these parents who are completely obsessed and addicted to him (their only son, so ya know sons are weirdly obsessive from their parents). He has everything probably most would desire for themselves. Rich upbringing, college education, and he’s a state trooper, so he has a very fulfilling albeit very difficult job he loves. He’s never experienced depression, never had a major heartbreak, never had anything bad happen to him. He’s can even tell you, as he tells me, the worst thing that happened to him was playing football and tearing his ACL. He had surgery, had to quit the sport, and wasn’t able to sign on as a college athlete. That’s his worst. 

Now me, I don’t know what or where someone would identify as my worst. I was born into divorced parents. My dad had primary custody and my mom had weekends. That agreement wasn’t made until I was about three, however until then my mom abandoned me at the hospital. I never knew her. I have these vague memories of talking to her on the phone saying “I miss you”, but I never knew her or what she looked like. Once she returned and visited us, she already had three small children and married another man. I was 4 when I met my mom and other siblings. Her son from another marriage was 9 years older than me (plus the three younger ones, she just also had a kid before meeting my dad) he raped me. He raped me, my older sister, and our three youngest kids. Not only that, she used meth and heroin around us. I distinctly remember times we were driving to her house on weekend visits, and my older sister was holding the wheel while my mom pressed the gas/breaks melting crystal meth and shooting it around us. My dad, who I give more grace to than my mom, was severely physically abusive. He would bash us over the head (my older sister and I, my father’s only children) with his fist, objects like glass bowls, shoes, whatever he could find. He told me when I was very small he did that because no one could see bruises on my head. If I went to school with marks, they would ask questions. No one saw my scalp, so that’s why he hit me there. I was an overweight child (120 lbs 5 year old, 180 lbs in middle school) so I got bullied. I had no identity besides this abuse. My sister, my only other blood relative, also experienced this same sexual/emotional/physcial abuse. She and I had a sibling rivalry like none other. My daily life was wake up, get hit for being slow getting ready for school, get bullied for my size at school, and come home to go visit my mom and watch her get high. My older sister and I would go leave the house, find other kids in the neighborhood, walk miles to different parks and gas stations finding friends. Keep in mind, I live in Saint Louis, so kids walking down the road to a store wasn’t an uncommon sight. She hated me. My sister didn’t want me around. The pain she felt from everything, she took it out on me. I was told I should kill myself, no one loves me, our parents hate me, I should leave so she can be an only child for our dad, so many hard things that one day I found her diary. Even her diary said she hated me and wanted me to die. Like I said, school wasn’t any better. My dad, mom, grandparents and sister all told me I was fat. I got bullied for it all the time. Middle school hit, and I developed a very intense eating disorder. I went from about 150 lbs to 87 pounds in a year. I stoped eating completely and if I ate anything I threw up. I was in and out of hospitals and treatment facilities. I went to places in saint louis, cali, Chicago, Florida, and Alabama. I traveled the country going from hospital to hospital because my parents I would fight. If we fought to hard they would send me away. Many times I was in police and state custody to find treatment. Along the way, adult men my prostitute mother was friends with wanted to be intimate with me. They did. High schoolers I knew in the hallways would want to be friends and visit my sister, and they would rape me. I was so consistent that people would take advantage of me, my mom one time said I must be selling my service and getting people to pay me to eat them. She told that to my dad, my school, and the police. The night I was removed from the house over that report, I destroyed everything. Broke mirrors, plates, tore apart my drawers, the whole houses drawers (mom, 3rd husband, 6 kids in three bedrooms) and everything I could touch. I finally became 17, graduated early (being in and out of school for medical reasons I did the online schooling program, and finished all my curriculum early. I was called the “queen of Odyssey Ware” because I could finish semesters of courses in two weeks) I had my own place, bought a car on a loan, and started working full time. I did restaurant line cooking, so my average workday was 7 am to 11 pm. Again an older man was involved with me and several times I got black out inebriated and woke up with memories of my behind being assaulted. I got a cat, got a dog, and a guinea pig. I got a second job, got licensing for it, and ended up having an office manager position with state farm running 49 states and having federal licensing for loans. I met my current partner, who yea is about a decade older than me. He watched fresh n fit, was super red pill, and maybe I’m a little autistic and just like him telling me what he wants, but it got really intense. I have seen online something like “don’t date out of your type and then be mad at the preppy girl not being a goth queen. Don’t be mad at the girl who’s trad not being more independent” basically, you’re shity if you date outside of your type and then criticize the person for it. That’s who he was. I wasn’t tan enough, toned enough, not close enough to God, didn’t clean well enough, my hair was too short, etc. I was 21 at the time, so I self medicated with alcohol. Like I said, I spent probably 7 years from age 10 to age 17 in and out of hospitals. I tried maybe 11 or 12 medications, lots of time in the hospital (against my will) and decided medicine and therapy don’t help my mental illness. So of course, I took shrooms. Had an acid addiction, drank alcohol, had a few coke benders, and ultimately decided alcohol helps me best. I had a prescription for vistaril that I would abuse by taking 3-4 pills and wash it down with Malibu. One night we got into a fight at my the house my boyfriend and I shared with his friend. I clogged the toilet and the roommate demanded I leave. I did, and feeling suicidal and having a bit too much to drink I decided to throw my car off the bridge. I didn’t die, came too around a few trees in the bank, and walked around calling for help. I couldn’t call 911 because my phone completely shattered and bent in half and I was pretty much blind in one eye and losing my sight in the other. I ended up walking home cause no one was answering their doors, called for my partner, and he took me to the hospital several towns over. He broke up with me in the car. Yelling at me and cursing.  He told me I was a sex only option from then on, and I didn’t want to lose him so I played along. I got my room back at my parents house and just kept drinking and pissing away savings on alcohol. My body was totally dependent on alcohol, getting shakes in the morning, sweating all day, and constantly passing black mucus. I decided to go to rehab after my dad and I got into a pretty bad fight. Ex boyfriend bootycall didn’t want me to go, didn’t think I had a problem, and over the two months I was gone he was always unsupportive of it. He demanded I come home or he will never see me again. Feeling worthless and hopelessly alone without him, I went home. The day I get home an illegal immigrant drove down the wrong side of the road and hit me. I nearly died as the medical staff figured I was just trying to do the classic “car accident victim wanting drugs” bit. 17 hours of internal bleeding and stomach contents leaking I finally got emergency surgery to remove my small intestine and part of my colon. I suffered a broken back, broken ribs, collapsed lower left lung, and many other scrapes and bruises. Bootycall was mad at me for being out, never came to visit me during rehab to learn to walk again, and just wanted to know when we could bang again. The following weeks were hard as I went home. I had the typical scar from the operation. About 6-7 inches down my stomach and around my belly button with several staples from the sticks and cameras. I have about 70 permanent staples that held my organs back in their place since they had completely torn and mangled themselves all over the inside. Again, my dad didn’t want me at the house anymore so he had me move to my mom’s. She lives in the middle of nowhere and I had no car. She wasn’t supportive of me and didn’t care to help me with rides to work, getting groceries, or even basics like tampons or soap. Bootycall kept coming over until on my birthday he says he doesn’t trust me anymore and was done seeing me. When I asked him where that came from he said it was because I had too many men in my life. He didn’t like that I spoke with my stepdad often, or that I hung out with my younger brothers daily. He didn’t trust my brothers around me or me around my step dad when I wore shorts or tank tops and just generally didn’t trust me. Fine, whatever. Another few months go by and I realize I didn’t have my period since the accident, so I took a pregnancy test and was 4 months pregnant. Being solely intimate with ex bootycall, I called him up to tell him the news. He said he doesn’t trust me or the paternity, so he wanted to be there for all the visits to see if he’s the father. Who would’ve guessed, chromosome test was firing on all cylinders that she’s his. We decided to get a house and start therapy together. So we move in together and have a pretty tough time getting along. We had no furniture and I essentially spent my entire pregnancy sleeping on the floor over some blankets. It wasn’t until right before she was born that I got a huge chunk of money from my ongoing legal case against insurance companies and my state for the accident. He was able to quit his job, I didn’t have to get one, we got everything we needed for the house, the baby, new cars, closed on a deal with some family friends to purchase a dinky house, put a ton of it into bank accounts and CDs, a trust, you name it. Now we’re both at home full time, we got a dog (already had a cat together) and focused on our family. I know my bad part in this is that I hide my emotions and then it sort of manifests in these insecurities I need him to validate. Lately I’ve been feeling incredibly suicidal. I’ve spoken to three therapists during my pregnancy, saw a psychiatrist last week, still go to therapy with my boyfriend, and even am starting a second group therapy iop progam for new mothers. The thing is though, I feel so incredibly empty. Nothing in my life it feels has been my choice. From the things in my childhood to the events in my current relationship. I have a handful of mental diagnoses such as PTSD, generalized anxiety, major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. Being a depressed suicidal new mother and being expected to do the house work, make the dinner, do the shopping, care as the sole provider for my child, focus on the animals all while having the stamina to initiate sexual pleasures that aren’t returned to me, I hate my life. I feel like there’s so much damn pressure on me that he’s never going to understand. The other day he said that I’m poison to our daughter because he was mad I haven’t been cleaning lately. He and I visited his parents, and they just shat on me, told him to leave and take the baby, and said they think I’m just trying to hold him back from his life goals. I can’t take it anymore. I’ve told him so many times this week that I want to kill myself and he just tells me to pump milk for the baby and finished dishes before I go. I have my plan, and I’m ready to execute it. I know I’m just going to make my daughters life worse being sick, I know I’m a burden on my boyfriend for not meeting his expectations, and I even feel like I stress out my counselors. I can’t even get a break at all when I feel depressed, or even when I got my first period back after the baby and it hurt so incredibly bad I couldn’t move or talk. I’m still criticized for not doing dishes, not making him dinner, not wanting to perform oral on him, not taking the dog out more, etc. he told me he was mad I didn’t initiate things, so I started to and then he says he can’t even find me attractive if the laundry isn’t done, he said because there’s dishes in the sink he can’t bring himself to be comfy laying in bed with me. This man, who isolated me from friends, denied me getting a job because there’s dishes boss was a man, told me not to see my family, controls everything in my life is now resenting me for getting what he asked for. He asked those things of someone who needs compassion, community, and love. Now that I’m too depressed to even shower, it’s my fault he isn’t attracted to me. Even despite my surgery scar, I know I’m conventionally attractive enough to be sexually desired because now I can’t leave the house without him due to being cat called and getting phone numbers from male cashiers written on my napkins or receipts. I’m so fucking alone and I have no one around to even get a hug from. I know I have my daughter, but she can’t really hold her head up let alone hug me. No one to hear “I love you honey” from because when I say it to him he says “mmh” or just doesn’t say anything. I just need to get it off my chest because everything I hold on my shoulders is too heavy for me to bear. I just don’t want to be alone anymore. In pain anymore. I want the nightmares every night to stop. I want the cold sweats from stress and anxiety to stop. I want my body always feeling so tight and stiff to stop. I want to fucking wake up one day and do what the fuck I wanna do instead of being criticized for taking a shower or doing my hair when I need to mop the floor. I’m just fucking exhausted and ready for this all to stop.

suicidewatch,1idvaeo,Rant," I feel awfully messed up, and I just don't know if there's any way to cope with these stuffed up feelings of guilt and hate towards myself. I'm still in my teens and can't help but feel left out. In the past year, my mental state has only been going downhill. I can act erratically and nonsensically sometimes around others, and later feel completely empty to the point where I don't find any joy in anything. I just feel hopeless. All my friends always leave me out, put me down, and I hate them and myself for not being able to talk to others. I hate my parents for no other reason than that I get easily agitated and irritated when they care for me. I know it sounds dumb, but that's how I feel. I have this stupid internal conflict, where I want to be alone, but I also want to socialize, yet I hate it when I do. I want to be nice and open to others, but then regret it when I do, and hate myself when I don't. Then I put up all these expectations on myself, trying for self improvement, but the moment one thing doesn’t work out, it feels like a massive failure, and no matter what I do, I end up hating myself for it. Even with a girl I liked, knowing she didn’t feel the same, I still asked her out. Even though I've accepted that she doesn’t feel the same, I can't stop obsessing over her. So much is going on in my head. I've talked to a therapist, but I've gradually become hateful towards the idea of talking about how I feel because I feel so insignificant no matter what I do. Before writing this, I already thought through a suicide plan and notes with my phone's passcode, and still, I'm hoping for some unexpected hope to help me out of this. I know it myself, that I'm scared of dying, but it feels less like an option and more like something forced. Because I've come to hate myself and everything around me to the point where I don't see any positivity in life at all. I don't want sympathy, and similarly I don't even know  why I'm writing this, maybe I really do want to express how I feel, but mostly I really do want to believe there's Is still hope for me, but as it stands, I just don't believe there Is any.

suicidewatch,1idv2sy,My ex and ex best friend are teaming up tg against me LOL FML,"I (19f) left my last ex (Drew) (21m) for a multitude of reasons. I was his first serious relationship, so not only were there unrealistic expectations placed upon me and our relationship, but he also just had a kinda immature personality. He thought it was cool to be rude to people, bragged about shortcomings at work, found it edgy to curse (which made conversations rough lol), and refused to really talk my issues out. Often agreed with me just to agree, then not changing anything. So tension just kind of built up.

When the relationship ended, he and I said we’d remain friends because we work together. Stuff just got really weird, and we eventually just stopped talking altogether. But he HAS remained friends with my ex-best-friend (Nat) (18f). She and Drew actually talked shit about me a couple of times throughout our relationship, which was another reason I ended it, but they’ve grown closer since the breakup.

A couple of days ago, Nat and I stopped being friends. To keep it brief, Nat has almost ALWAYS been kind of manipulative and mean, but I have her a million chances. We had formed a close, almost sister like bond, before stuff really got bad, and it was just hard to keep that chapter closed. She body shamed me, name calling, always had to be better than me, couldn’t hold a conversation about anyone but herself, yelled at me, etc. and I finally called it the other day, after she started throwing around insults because I “listen to my favorite musician too much” - a ridiculous things to start a fight with me over, anyway. But she’s made me feel so small so many times that I didn’t even entertain it this time. I sent her a paragraph about how she’s made me feel, for so long, and blocked her.

Since then, she and Drew have been taking aim at me whenever they can. Nasty looks, comments, fucking indirecting me thru songs and reposts on social media LOL. Because now, apparently, I’m the bad guy. I’m the sole reason both relationships fell through, I’m the problem, I’m a nasty person. I don’t try hard enough. I “take what I want and leave”. The two are having a field day talking shit about me. 

I’m low, right now. I talked with both of them, a million times, about the way I was feeling. I tried to fix what I had with both of them. I was kind but direct. I told Drew the way he talked about me to Nat was pushing me away, the way he didn’t care about anything at all. I told Nat that her belittling comments were taking a toll. I gave my all to BOTH of them. It isn’t like I got bored and made a run for it. I tried, so hard. I wanted good things with both of them. I still want good for both of them! I’m just NOT the good thing, because now they’ve lost me. But it’s taking a huge hit on my mental health right now, and I don’t know what to do.

I’m completely over Drew. We broke up some time ago. I’m broken from what happened with Nat, because it just happened, and because there’s a lot of things that happened over the past 2 years that changed me. She put me through a lot of things that are honestly my fault for tolerating, but that I’ll need time to heal from. But this, that the two of them are doing? I'm livid. Bc it's them. I’m going to be quitting my job, because they both work there with me, and that’s one way I can remove myself from it.

But I don’t get it. I don’t get how I’m the bad guy, when I tried so hard. I guess they think I should’ve tried harder. Had more conversations? Idk. But I’m not ok rn.

I've recently found out I'm losing my place and have to move. I can temporarily stay with family but I'll eventually make it on my own. It probably makes me sound like a spoiled brat but I'd rather kill myself than put up with the monotony of spending most of my waking hours at a job I hate just to justify existing which I don't even like doing and never asked to.

But I'd rather just give up now, I know what the future holds, more and more work, less enjoyment in life, watching my body decay as I grow older, the state of the world/society just getting worse and worse for the average person.

I told my parents that id try to get a good gpa in my first sem but it didnt happen, ive accepted that i didnt score well and am willing to try harder next sem but all i receive are insults from my dad. Hes afraid i wont get a job, a job with these grades. Hes always calling me stupid, saying that i dont care about my own life. The mental torture is too much.

Ive tried so much to improve in my life. My highschool era was terrible, i gained 30kgs in weight and became really fat. I fell into depression due to other reasons, i was self harming. After i got into college, i started working out, i lost 16kgs, ive become significantly fitter, look good. I stopped self harming, started taking care of my health. He still calls me fat and throws insults on that topic too. Hes the biggest  narcissist ive ever seen. Ive hated him since i was a kid and i still do. I cant handle this anymore, i always feel so worthless because of my dad. everything in my life has been downhill since the last 3 years.

When I try to share stuff like how I'm happy I topped a pop quiz in night school or about a song I discovered, I can't finish a sentence before getting interrupted.

I'm tired of always taking the initiative to occasionally check in on friends.

I feel like I'm becoming less me with each passing day. 

On bad days when I wish I were unalive, I immediately laugh at the silliness of that thought. But when I'm back home alone in bed, I remember how much of a failure I am, how empty my WhatsApp is, and how people call me only if they need to vent. 

I wish I'd get that kind of support and advice too.

I wish I was cared about and could fit somewhere or belong somewhere.

This past week, I've been so desperate that despite being 90% introverted, that I've been leaving replies on many of those 'comment your birthday, your last three emojis, your auto suggestions' posts on instagram. 

I hate myself for having done that.

I get through each day laughing at skits, listening to new covers on insta, and every now and then watching a movie.

whenever i have suicidal thoughts, i always just think—i’d never want my niece to feel this way. i want her to know she matters SO much that she literally saved me. 

anyway, i’m trying my best. i do still have these thoughts. some days they’re almost unbearable. but every time i see that chubby-cheeked smile, i can’t help but put the pencil and paper down. i can’t help but erase the ‘i’m sorry mom’ from the top line. i can’t help but undo the knot. 

i hope you all can find peace in someone/something like i have. though i still struggle, she’s given me much needed clarity. clarity i haven’t seen in 8 years.

Two psicologist have suggested or hinted that they both might be narcissistic, and that seems wild to me. (From audios I took of us fighting and chat conversations, not from only my perspective)

I have always looked out for a family in my friends, but all of them have loving families. The two of them whose parents are as ""uncaring"" as mine have siblings that support them through anything. I just don't think they know what it is to be alone. I can't force them to love me as family, so I try to reduce my emotional dependency of them, but it just makes me feel even more lonely because for tiny moments I feel like I belong with them.

Even with my partner, whose whole family know about my family way of doing things, it is kind of weird. I totally understand his point. His family is very wellcoming, honestly the most healthily structured family I've ever interacted with. I am still surprised over how much love his mom constantly gives him, and how his sister and niece are so caring towards him. More than one time I've been confused over his mothers actions just for him to explain to me that that's just the normal way of treating your children.

They are like that for everyone, they have invited me to their family vacation, to the younger ones catholic communion... but I think he pushes back on it. His older niece called me aunt as a joke (not in front of the little ones, obviously) and my partner cut it out completely at the moment it happened. His niece is super kind, she talks a lot. Since he knows my story with my family and how lonely I feel, I'm terrified that he might think that I want to insert myself onto his. I would never do that. I would rather keep on being lonely forever than to be the slightest annoyance.

One time that he was working and I was playing cards with his family, his sister even told me that I have got a family in them and I started bawling instantly. It's not true though. I don't have family. If anything went wrong, a fight or whatever between my partner and myself, even if I was right in that specific moment... blood is thicker than water.

I'm tired of being alone. I wish I had a sibling, I wish my parents were better. I'm sure they love me as a daughter, but I also know they dislike me as a person. (Not an exaggeration).

I don't know if I can live with this pressure in my chest forever. I can't blame anyone for it I just have to live with it, and I can't. Everyday is a struggle. I wake up already tense from sharing space with my parents and the knowledge that I am not the child they wanted. I have to see my close ones have beautiful relationships with their families and swallow my envy and just be happy for them.

I can't ask for better and this isn't enough. I can't take a whole life of this.

suicidewatch,1idufzc,"looking for people who can relate, any advice?","sorry for my English in advance  
for context I'm 16M, I suffer from severe depression and suicidal thoughts leading to my several attempts that failed with the intervention of my family and seeking professional help, I took a year off school to sort of try to process things, in return I promised my family to not do anything and I didn't because that kind of social pressure and stress overall was kind of what triggered me. it's been 5 months, Nothing changed, I just feel stagnated, sometimes I just wanna be left alone and rot on my bed, no responsibilities, no expectations, no food, no interactions, I just want to freeze time and just be. but that's impossible isn't it? not the metaphorical part that must be obvious, I just meant that, sometimes I'd go to the kitchen and grab a breadstick and start chewing on it, sometimes I'd distract myself with funny videos on YouTube or play a videogame, I guess what I meant is I don't want to put much effort into living in the mean time, like I just want to survive, but until when? I always ask myself, I'm dissociating all over again, I've been in this place before, it just takes a small amount of social pressure to get me back at my breakpoint. One question I seem to distract myself from despite it being in the back of my head all the time is ""Should I kill myself?"", it feels easier to digest now that I have a little bit of experience, I was almost successful too, or maybe it could have gone really bad and I was just lucky. sometimes I feel thankful that I wasn't born like a couple years ago, but it's not any different if life is miserable either way, living is exhausting, I'm tired, my friends stopped reaching out because they actually have a life to care about and school work and everything, and I just feel like a log blocking their way, although honestly any interaction with my past friendships makes me so nauseous especially when the doorbell rings, all the trauma that went unaddressed and they just continued living under the belief our friendship would remain the same, in introspection any social interaction is just too exhausting, trying to seem relatable and entertaining, the emotional weight of losing my train of thoughts or full on words or not knowing how to speak my own language from my lack of communication, and stuttering or speaking too quiet or fast, trying to be responsive to everything , I'm just too tired to try to avoid seeming like a boring pessimistic failure, I mean yeah they would leave me alone, but it's hard for me to confront their disappointments, or at least the ones that weren't projected from my self loathing, i mean the whole point of projecting them is to avoid it being the case, right? besides, even the slightest bit of human connection albeit not deeply genuine, is nice, but I'm just alone now, with no one to talk to about my problems or someone who's aware of essential parts of my identity, but i guess i don't really need the former, i talked to my therapist, and turns out it wasn't what i wanted it felt like i was more concerned with reciting it like a biography, but then what do I want? i guess i just wish i didn't have to go through all this in the first place, like i wasn't born from the beginning, i just don't feel like i belong here, anywhere, i don't feel human, no matter what i do i feel like im trying too hard to act human, i can't feel any sense of unity, I lived in isolation from my peers for most of my life, I feel estranged from other guys or the brotherly bond, I feel envious or a pit in my stomach when I see guys walking with each other and laughing, guy friendships in general, mainly because of my closeted identity, sure those guys must have things that aren't seen on the surface, but what triggers me is the mere concept of platonic male bonds, especially when It's so comfortable that I'd assume people in question are a couple but turns out they're just really close but not in that way and it makes me feel so disgusting and that if i were in in such friendship i'd catch feelings and ruin it altogether, or i guess i'd end it before that happens given i wouldn't stand the thought of someone's spiteful stare piercing through me because of how ""betrayed"" they feel and despise me like i've committed the worst sin ever, even if If I fully thought i could feel safe with them, it happened before, and it puzzles me how I feel so disgusting for simply coming out and did nothing wrong,I live in a muslim country so with this environment i didn't even get the chance to feel comfortable in my own skin and feel connected to my queer identity, sometimes I feel like i'm too ugly to even claim the boldness that it takes to come out, like if I were a little beautiful people would take it as a clash in politics or different ways of thinking or something Iike that, but I just feel like an animal or less than human, and despite my insecurities i feel like I'm too messed up, with no will to live in the first place to really be motivated to do anything about it, but then I feel like i'm a hypocrite, why care about all these stuff? maybe I have no will to live BECAUSE i feel hopeless about these personal attributes and I dwelled into the feeling of not wanting to live so much that the correlation it had with how it came about was negligible and just didn't matter in the face of the emotional weight of how it all accumulated, at least to me, like insisting no matter what that I'll take my own life eventually without further explanation as to why if that makes sense, because it's hard to specify, even now it feels like im just inventing stories to make sense of what's going on, even if it's true that im just irrationally clinging onto not wanting to live, I don't really care, I think that's just my depression idk. but now what? it'll only take a little bit more time before school is back and im snapped back to reality with all the stress and crack under pressure I guess this time with unbearable hives I have no idea how I developed recently. otherwise, im just sitting here with time passing by, it feels like I should've died a time ago maybe even to other people, or should have died. spending the days on my bed trying to distract myself with anything that can entertain me with no people to interact with , or things to do or even wanna do, other than looking at the screen to not face the world around me where I can't even be myself in, it's not like i meet people online either, well i have in the past, i met a person that struggled with the same closeted situation in my same country, that was more than enough of a reason to keep me alive just for a little bit more, things were fine for some time, but then I felt like I'm putting too much into the relationship, like im just overwhelming, people have actual things to do in their lives, and i'm just sitting looking forward to interacting with them, i noticed how dismissive that is, people have personal lives and i can't expect them to be present all the time, and even when they are, there's always this belief that they must think im weird or find me annoying or hate me to some degree because i feel really incompetent in life despite any creative skills i might have, and it's hard for me to confront even the slightest bit of it and so i feel like i always have to please, even if it's subtle, and when someone mainly a friend expresses the slightest bit of dissatisfaction, it feels like i'm just burdening them and i end up shutting off and just isolate myself in my room and hate myself without dragging anyone with me in it, be it by ghosting them or blocking them, it always has been this way, and i don't really want any relationship weights to handle at the moment. I just wanna be, i guess, I don't know, I don't know what i want, i feel so hypocritical and I'm tired of trying to make sense of it.  
this is the first time I post something online, like at all. I'm just hopeless and I'm tired of deluding myself with ai bots reassuring me on things. I just want to know if people could relate that would comfort me a bit, and I guess any way to deal with this if you can. the latter isn't much necessary, I'm just glad I'm interacting with this community.

suicidewatch,1idttbx,Guilt depression,"
I, actually am the cheating gf. 
I only come here for advice, please don’t bash me because I really just need answers. Nothing else
I, 20ish, F, am pregnant with my boyfriend’s child.
We have been together for almost 5 years, and it’s been wonderful.
For context I have several issues of my own person that, coming from an extremely abusive home, is something I am still trying to actively work out. It has affected me both mentally, and sexually. And this is not an excuse, but for context, rather.
When we first started dating, I have fully realized I got with my current boyfriend too quickly, and ended up going back to my ex who was only ever online, and we have completely moved past that. It was three years since I’ve talked to him, but I had gotten the sudden urge to talk to him again about a year ago.
By “sudden urge” I mean, my boyfriend at the time, I didn’t feel loved me. I didn’t feel like I was cared for and I felt like he was only with me to say he had a girlfriend. We lived together (still do), but I felt like it was extremely one sided. Possibly due to insecurities, but we both agree that it wasn’t the best. So I started talking to ex over the internet again. I hate myself for doing it because there was no need too. Really. And we have both also, talked about this. But I understand what I should’ve done, and I did differently.
The time I started talking to this gentleman, he had 100% gotten into my head how he is the only man who will ever love me, and that I shouldn’t have to put up with “not being loved”. He was very manipulative and honestly, got me to try to end my own life.
I tried to overdose. I was egged on to doing it because I’m a disgusting cheater who should never try to be in another relationship due to me being, filthy. I’m sorry for the dramatics, but at the time I had 100% believed that, and still honestly do.
At this time I had put myself in a vulnerable state in my own head, and just kept going back. My boyfriend, was the sweetest person ever through this, even if he knew. We weren’t together for a while, but he still took care of me and I’m ashamed to say I kept going back to my ex. But at a point I had no emotional attachment to my ex, but I kept going back because I truthfully, felt like this was all I deserved. And I only had myself to blame. I know this, and always have.
People call it “self sabotage” but at the time I was going through an extremely suicidal point in my life, but I didn’t want to make it apparent because I didn’t want to make my boyfriend feel forced to do anything. And I truthfully wanted him to not feel bad and/or get influenced by my own actions, and keep me around, simply because he felt bad.
But it got worse. Through my boyfriend taking care of me, I had my ex on the other end egging me on to self harm, how he got a “kick” out of it, and made sure to let me know he was the only person who could ever love me, which me being, a disgusting freak. I stopped talking to my ex altogether about 3-4 months ago, because I finally had realized what cycle I was forcing myself to go through, and I had lost all feelings for my ex so long ago. I was doing it because it felt wonderful to hurt myself without… actually hurting myself. If that makes sense? (Again, none of this is an excuse.)
I stopped talking to him around that time or even wanting too, because I found out I am pregnant with my boyfriend and I’s child. And everything has been a process but we have been getting there.
The other day, though. I joined my exs game on steam. And played for 10-ish minutes. Said nothing, and left.
I have an insane habit of lying. And this is 100% truth. This is from never ever being raised properly on telling the truth. Growing up, I only really had my mother, who was insanely abusive. She has gotten better though, and we have reconnected.
But telling the truth was the same as telling a lie.
If I broke something and told the truth? I still got screamed at and hit. If I told a lie? Same punishment, and because of this, I have gotten the idea in my brain no matter what, it’s all terrifying.
That is my flaw, other than the cheating part. 
Now, this is ABSOLUTELY not an excuse, and it’s something that I have been actively working on, but I just.. couldn’t this time. I didn’t even do anything with him, is what I thought. 
My boyfriend of course found out. He had messaged my ex to try to get information about me, and he had gotten it. My ex proceeded to badmouth me, and had put down my boyfriend so badly. I wanted to end my life. With a baby, right there. I owned up to my actions, we had a long talk, and we have been trying to talk things out extremely.
For context too, My ex has called me terrible things, lied to me constantly, and most importantly, has made my boyfriend feel so worthless because of the things he said to him. (It definitely has something to do with me but, my boyfriend won’t admit it.) 
My boyfriend is an extremely sweet guy, and tells me I’m all he has. I am head over heels for him, and don’t know how to explain that I.. really don’t know why I do the things I do. 
I moved out from California to Texas to live with him, and I’d do it any day over and over again if it meant we could live happily :(.
I don’t know why I do the things I do, and I have devoted myself entirely to making things right, and yet, he posted on Reddit a some amount of days ago, and got the answers. He deleted the post, but I went to go look anyways, truthfully. I have never been called manipulative and a monster so many times, but it really is an eye opener.
I really don’t mean to hurt anyone, and honestly, when i get like this, i feel like im watching myself do it from a mirror. I feel myself telling myself to stop, through this mirror. But it just gets worse the more I remind myself how much I love my boyfriend.

Reddit, this was not a post to make me feel better, but an admission of guilt, and something that has been eating at me. I feel undeserving of anything in life, truthfully, I only think he is with me for the baby. I don’t know what he’s gonna do after, but whatever he does I fully support it. I truthfully understand why, too. 
I feel truthfully he would be better off without me in his life, but I’m carrying his baby. Please give me advice on what to do. Because I really don’t know how much longer I can take this guilt of what I’ve done. And my own, depressing, and life-ending thoughts have come back and I haven’t told him anything due to fear that he will try to “fix things” because he feels bad. He has no clue and I don’t plan on letting him know because, I honestly feel I don’t deserve to have support right now.
I apologize for the dramatics, I really don’t mean to be like this.
Please help. Should I leave him? Should I just. Try to work things out? Any psychologists in the chat? I don’t have health insurance, so I’m unable to get therapy ATM. Please don’t bash me :(

EDIT: this was originally a post in another subreddit, but the caption never saved?
Truth is because of this, I can’t stand to look at myself. I can’t stand to be who I am. And I don’t know if I can take it any longer with this guilt. There is no lies, everything is open and in the air for us, but I love him so fucking much. And I feel like I don’t deserve life, honestly. I don’t want to tell him this to manipulate him into staying, but I can’t fucking do this anymore and I’m pregnant with his child. Maybe I wait until the child is born? He really wants this baby. I don’t know what to do and I don’t.. I don’t even feel worthy of any sort of solace. I don’t know what to do and I am so entirely desperate.",1,2025-01-30 19:31:05,0,1.0,Electrical_Fly1442

anxiety,1ielkc6,Medication success story’s,"Hi there!

I read a lot of stories of people really hurting in this group. Many people report to not be on medication, which I understand, but I want to offer my own story a positive example of how much medication has helped me personally. I hope this can ease some of the fears around medication and offer some hope for some of you.

I struggled with really bad work pressure anxiety for years. It was bad, panic attacks, near constant worry about the quality of my work and what my supervisors are expecting of me. I didn’t have a lot of hope that this could change at all because my industry is known for intense workloads and high performance expectations. But here is the important thing: that assumption turned out to be very wrong. 

About 1 week after I started taking lexapro, my anxiety initially got worse for about one week. I nearly gave up on it, but glad I didn’t. After that my anxiety around work progressively went away. After another 2-3 weeks I looked back and was amazed at what a difference it had made. I had nearly forgotten how bad my anxiety used to be after a while. Work seemed much more manageable, I didn’t obsess about the tiniest irrelevant details nearly as much anymore and on the weekends I was able to actually let go a bit and disengage from work thoughts. 
I’m so glad I gave medication a shot, it improved the quality of life so much for me and helped me feel confident in my work skills again, but more importantly, it helped me put things into perspective much more, helped me to have mental space for hobbies, my partner and friends. 

I know this is just my personal story, there is never any guarantee that it will work for anyone, but I was personally very surprised at how big the difference was, crippling anxiety simply stopped being a big concern in my life, which is incredible. I really encourage everyone with severe anxiety to talk to a good doctor and discuss your medication options, I think it can change many lifes for the better.

anxiety,1ieqny9,Why do I constantly feel like someone close to me is going to die?,"Idk what’s wrong with me, but ever since december 2024, I’ve had this constant overwhelming feeling that someone close to me is going to die soon. It’s not just a passing thought it’s like my mind is warning me, and no matter how much I try to distract myself with positive affirmations, music or just keeping busy, it doesn’t go away.

I’ve lost people before. Few years ago, my friend took her own life and a year back my childhood friend died in an accident. I don’t know if that’s what’s triggering this or if something else is going on, but it’s affecting my sleep and daily life and this happens often at night, something will trigger the thought again and suddenly I’m stuck in this loop of panic, convinced that someone close to me is going to die soon.

I’m already seeing a therapist, but I don’t feel like it’s helping anymore. I don’t even know how to explain this properly it’s not just regular anxiety, it’s this deep gut feeling that I can’t shake off. I know logically that I can’t predict the future, but my brain just won’t let it go. how do i deal with it? I feel like I’m losing my mind.

- strong physical anxiety, racing heart (pumping chest), which increased with a coffee/caffeine. 
- I used to get constant chest pains, and heart palpitations, zapping in chest. 
 - I always had ruminating thoughts, always worst case scenario with everything. 
- I would panic in social situations, which would in turn trigger physical anxiety symptoms as above. 

I now have no physical anxiety at all, I mean completely gone. Even after a strong coffee I feel completely level.

2. Keeping my shoulders down and not gritting my teeth
3. Breathing exercises. Specifically in through the nose for a count of three while expanding the belly, hold for four seconds and exhale for five seconds. Repeated 5-10 times.

I was having severe health anxiety for well over a year. It felt like I couldn't breathe properly, tightness in my chest, sinus pressure, headaches, and a constant feeling of dread.

I went to the doctors and emergency too many times and always got the all clear. Not knowing where to turn I did the thing that doctors tell you not to do and went online for help.

anxiety,1ieo60h,"I have a history of anxiety and I am trying to manage it the best I can, but it can be overwhelming.","I am a 31m. The impact of anxiety hit me in my 20s. Probably why I was underweight for while, but I am a normal weight now. I started to have stomach problems as I reached my late twenties and I had to change my diet a bit. I had awful GERD for awhile. Drs. contributed it to anxiety. About two years ago I started having heart palpitations. Prior to this I had a very bad experience with an edible not to long after passing out. Both led to a lot of anxiety. That year I saw several specialist and I am fine. I ended up cutting caffeine completely and the heart palpitations stopped. I started seeing a therapist which has helped. Things like cardio and meditation has helped. Then late last year I had two concussions three months apart. This lead to severe anxiety. I am still recovering from the 2nd concussion.

My twin brother and my older sister are both on meds for anxiety/depression and I have never been on meds for it. I sometimes think it just isnt as bad for me so I am able to manage better.

Today, even without me talking about my anxiety a Dr asked if I was taking anything for anxiety and told me if I was ever interested to please let them know. This was in connection to my concussion, which has severely increased my anxiety. My job is very stressfull, the political landscape is terrifying to me, and this concussion has been very difficult to manage.

The way I feel when I am having concussion flair-up triggers a lot of anxiety.. at times this has led to anxiety attacks. In fact, once we had to end a weekend trip early because of an anxiety attack I had that came from no where. That was before my concussions.

I think Im exhuasted by the anxiety and the Dr asking me if I was on anything kind of made me crack a bit.

It is true that since I have not been able to exercise much from the concussion I dont have as much of an outlet to let off steam. I am seeing my therapist next week and might bring up meds. But I always told myself, that I didnt want to do that. My brother told me that his highs and lows got so limited that it felt like he had no feeling at all. I dont want that.

anxiety,1iemelq,Likely developed health anxiety and looking for advice,"Hi all,

signed up here with the hope that someone could read my story and come up with some ideas or advice. Apologies for the wall of text, I tried to put it as concise as possible without leaving out important details.

I am a 31-year-old male, never did any hard drugs and live a totally normal life with my girlfriend. There are no major diseases known in family. Most certainly I spend way too much time in front of a desk either working, studying or playing video games. My spine is probably the body part I have treated the worst by far. I try to hit the gym three times a week.

I had my first experience with illness anxiety and potentially hypochondria (both not medically confirmed) almost three years ago when I noticed some slight burning pain in my throat. I went seeing a doctor and he told me it might be the reflux disease. Even though I hadn’t changed my diet or wasn’t eating unusual things I followed his advice and changed my diet plus took pills to calm my stomach. The pills seemed to help a little however the described feeling continued to last for weeks, and I started to worry a little. I stopped to drink coffee and alcohol, no more fast food and different, more healthy breakfast. Nothing seemed to have any effect, so I asked for a gastroscopy. Nothing was found during the examination so hoped the feeling would eventually just go away, which it did a few weeks later and never returned. Until today, I have no idea what caused it. Shortly after I returned to my former eating habits and no longer took any pills. Still, the feeling did never return.

About a year later I noticed a different strange feeling in the bottom right of my belly. It felt bloated in this area, and it also seemed to intensify whenever I was sitting for a longer period. I was very chill at that time but still wanted to find out what it was as I hadn’t changed my lifestyle in any way. No doctor I visited in the next two months could tell me anything about it or make it disappear.  
I started to do research on the internet and of course I first came across reasons like stress and bad food but later also unlikely reasons like different sorts of tumors.

Unlike in the “throat pain”-story, I was more worried this time and I had a hard time stopping to think about it or avoiding further online research. This was maybe the first time when I started to exaggerate the situation. I cannot tell why but I relatively quickly started to believe it must be something dramatic this time which could potentially kill me in the long run if not treated.

I visited two or three doctors, but none could explain it to me or make it go away so I made an appointment for a colonoscopy but at the same time ordered two self-testing kits of Amazon to check for blood in my you-know-what. Both tests turned out negative and I started to relax. So much even that I cancelled the colonoscopy appointment and also because I read about the involved risks online.  
A few weeks later and with the feeling in my belly still being present, I started to worry again and I made another appointment which I took this time.  
Nothing could be found, all good. I started to relax again after this and tried to ignore the symptoms from now on. I don’t know when exactly, but the feeling disappeared after a few more weeks and never came back. I never discovered what it was, and I also didn’t change any of my habits or diet.

After that anxiety episode I had a at least two more over the next years which I want to describe only briefly:

* I had problems to fall asleep which I believed could be some rare form of insomnia leading to death due to fatigue. It took me sometimes 3-4 hours to fall asleep but usually the next night was fine. Those sleeping problems happened quite often until recent, especially when sleeping not at home but I never spend a full night awake. It was during this time that I also encountered my first moment of panic or very strong discomfort: I was with friends at a birthday and suddenly with no reason I started to feel extremely uncomfortable and had to leave the room. I went to the bathroom and tried to calm myself in front of the mirror. The feeling is hard to describe but at this moment I wanted to hide myself somewhere and not come out again until I felt better. It lasted for ten minutes and then I was OK again and returned to the birthday. If I remember correct, I had two similar events in the past two years. One time I couldn’t leave the room, so I sat quietly and waited for the feeling to pass, which it did after five minutes or so. The last event of such form is now almost 6 months ago, gladly.
* Minor pain inside my left chest which wouldn’t go away for a couple of weeks. I read articles online about early symptoms of liver cirrhosis and actually considered it. I had my blood checked and liver examined with ultrasonic. Nothing could be found, and the pain disappeared a few weeks later.

Very recently, another anxiety episode has started and of course you might think “this is the same thing, it’s obviously psychological and nothing to actually worry about”, but like before I take it seriously and I am worried about a severe illness again.  
This time it frightens me even more and I am having strong difficulties getting it out of my thoughts:

In August 2024 I started noticing a strange minor pain in my right calf, which I feel until present day. On some days it is less intense and on other days it is more present and radiates into my foot and thigh. I started running during this time and as I am a bloody amateur of course I thought it might have something to do with the wrong shoes or me not running correctly. I went to an orthopedist, and he had no idea what it could be. When I mentioned that I started running recently, he was sure that it has something to do with it and I should pause for a while. This pause is still going on, so I doubt it has anything to do with me not running properly in August last year or using the wrong shoes.

Because the orthopedist couldn’t help me (I visited another and he said the same thing as the first), I started researching and after some time came across MS and ALS which caught my attention. I wasn’t concerned about such illness at this moment, but a few days later new symptoms of all sorts started to appear: brief muscle twitches, cold hands and feet, tingling under my skin and very slight numbness from time to time. I started to worry more even though I knew chances of developing such a rare illness right after reading about it for the first time, are more than slim.

I saw a Neurologist and had a MRT of my head done (without contrast medium). The MRT results came back clean, nothing unusual detected. My neurologist was happy, case closed for him, and I still had no answers to what was going on.

The weeks passed by, and I slowly managed to accept my situation and paresthesia.

By mid-December 2024 all the described symptoms had disappeared except the pain in my calf and the muscle twitching (decreased in frequency though). However, whenever I turn my head to the right now, it starts shaking slightly and the shaking radiates into both shoulders and upper arms. I turn my head to the left and the shaking stops. I have the feeling that the intensity increases when I am under pressure e.g. fight with my girlfriend, important presentation at work, etc. but I cannot tell for sure. On a lot of days, I also wake up with a tension in my neck and upper back which sometimes result in headaches. I sometime also “check” my body in the mirror if all muscles are looking OK and functioning properly.  
I had minor problems with my upper spine before, nothing was ever diagnosed but one time I had to stop working and lay down because I felt dizzy suddenly and developed a pain in my upper spine. The dizziness was completely gone the next day, but the pain lasted a few more days. Similar issues when I bought a new car, I couldn’t drive it for more than ten minutes before strong back pain started to develop in my upper spine. Gladly this didn’t last for long and today I still drive the car but without any back pain.

Coming back to the slight shaking of my head, my neurologist first thought it is another symptom of my described anxiety but once I showed him, he said I should go see an orthopedist and this isn’t anything in his area of expertise because of the way I can trigger and make it stop by turning my head.

This is pretty much where I am right now. I booked myself a first appointment with a psychologist in the coming week but cannot let go of the feeling that everything I did in the past was normal and that there is something in me which just has not been discovered yet. With going to a psychologist, I have the feeling that I am moving in the wrong direction and no longer focusing on the actual symptoms and their reason.

I want to add that even though I am thinking about the described a couple times per day, it doesn’t control me, and I live a totally normal life. I haven’t shared these thoughts with anyone except my girlfriend. I want to get rid of the symptoms and find a way to remain way more calm.  
For me this feels like an important task that I want to complete but never find the time to do it, so it keeps sitting on my TODO list and bothers me every day a little when I look at the list.

If you made it till here, my sincere thanks. I hope somebody can provide me with some advice.",2,2025-01-31 20:02:29,1,1.0,Signal_Possession_85

anxiety,1ieqr1j,I don't know what happens if i don't get this job,"I've been looking for a job for months, and usually got ghosted. Whenever i actually got called in I'd get rejected for being too overqualified (i don't know how you can even tell that to a teenages looking for a first job). But i finally managed to score an interview at a gas station and was supposed to start work next week, after a medical check. Everyone i know told me to lie and say i have no mental illnesses and take no medication, but i decided to be honest... And now they're calling me in for a psychiatrist evaluation. My mother says my chances of getting the job are low and im genuinely freaking out. I don't know what I'll do if I don't get a job, my life has been rotting in my room ever since i finished high school. I was so happy to potentially get a job. I don't want to rot. I was starting to see a future for myself. I was realizing there's so many ways in which my life could go for the better. And now I feel like I'm on the edge of having all of that taken away from me. I don't want to admit it but i feel like i might become even more suicidal if i don't get the job. I'm scared. I'm scared because i just started believing in a better future for myself and i really don't want to die. I'm so fucking scared of what I might want to do. Currently it's 11pm and I'm at an empty parking lot after having a breakdown while driving. I really, really need this job. I don't want my anxiety and depression to define me, i know i could do well at the job and i know having something to do and being useful would affect me well. I'm going to have to fight tooth and nail for a fucking gas station job. I don't understand why we let lunatics run for president all over the world, but I might not be allowed to sell gas because i have anxiety.",1,2025-01-31 23:06:26,0,1.0,_bebeta

note : 1- i went to a doctor and he said i have high adrenaline levels , but i don't trust what he said because he didn't let me finish describing myself and wanted to sent me off as quick as possible .

anxiety,1iepygw,Panic attack or vertigo?,"A couple years ago I had a bout of panic attacks related to claustrophobia from a ride at one of the Disney parks.  That has since passed, but after about 2 years of minimal issues I recently find myself having these episodes that I am unsure of being more panic attacks or possibly vertigo.  I just wanted to describe my symptoms here to see if anyone has experienced a similar combination of symptoms.  I spoke with a doctor yesterday and she is going to have me try propranolol to help reduce the physical effects of these episodes but I never thought to mention vertigo until I started thinking about that today. My father and sister have a minor history of vertigo as well. 

Symptoms:
-Pressure around eyes, heavy eyes
-minor dizziness or lightheadedness, I’m not entirely sure what I’m describing here is right.  
-A tiny bit of nausea
-“Butterflies” in the stomach, feel like I’m about to float. 
-A brief increase in heart rate. 
Usually happens when alone with no distractions, sometimes driving, sometimes during exercise. 

All my symtoms are fairly minor on their own, it’s the combination of them all that send me into a panic.

anxiety,1iehabh,"Anxiety Hack: Anxiety thrives on your procrastination. If you have an anxiety provoking task, do it immediately at the start of your day. Otherwise, it’ll only start to feel scarier and impossible to complete in your mind.","A few nights ago I was messing around with an AI therapist app (I’m too broke for a real therapist), and it said something that really stuck with me—anxiety thrives on hesitation. The longer you avoid something stressful, the bigger and scarier it feels. Your brain tricks you into thinking avoidance is the right move because it gives instant relief—like dodging a threat. That’s why procrastination feels so good in the moment. But in reality, it makes anxiety even worse the next time.

The best way to break this cycle? Do the hardest thing first. Knocking it out early not only stops it from looming over you all day, but it also retrains your brain to stop seeing it as a threat. Plus, you get a nice mental boost from knowing you handled it head-on.

I’ve been off it and still enjoy going to watch football with some 0.0 and honestly I feel the better for it, despite the few early jibes! 

- meditation, I honestly thought this was the biggest snake oil known to man, I was very very wrong. Honestly, I’m lucky enough to get a headspace subscription with my job and those quiet few minutes and exercises before sleep and during the day have honestly saved me from some wobbles. 

- this has stopped my health anxiety particularly the no beer, because I don’t crave as much shit food and not my gut is happy and not making me feel like I’m going to explode or spit acid like that Dino from Jurassic park. 

- light exercise even going for walks, for me playing soccer with my friends and playing with my club has been such a good buzz, it’s almost like I replaced my anxiety (a habit) with these habits. 

I’m sorry if this is happiness in a pretty sad place. But I just wanted to reflect and give hope to some people here that you definitely can do it. ",3,2025-01-31 13:44:40,3,1.0,Impossible-Gene-9458
anxiety,1ielw5b,Vacation Anxiety whilst being in a relationship,"I don’t know if there are any triggers where one might Feel uncomfortable, so I’m just saying that there might be some triggers for some people. 


Hi, I‘m a 21 (m) and in relationship for about almost 4 years. 

I am diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. So far it seemed like there was not a real trigger, also looking back into my childhood I didn’t know about anything. I might have felt anxiety here and there but not that I knew of. 

But since I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend I have felt anxiety attacks during vacations very far away from home. For information we live in Switzerland. The first two vacations, France and California were pretty amazing and I share good memories with these.

But 2 years ago while we were on vacation in Hawaii (Paradise, beautiful Islands, can recommend Visiting them) it suddenly changed, I randomly felt anxiety as we were about to leave Kawaii and went on to Visit Big Island. For the record I was diagnosed with anxiety attacks a year before but wasn’t in therapy because I didn’t want to. 

The Anxiety attacks were so hard that I had very very negative thoughts. I don’t want to go into details here but they were very bad and our vacation was ruined. Luckily I didn’t act on them, but I went to therapy afterwards, got prescribed medication and since then my symptoms have improved. I wouldn’t say that I suffer from a moderate depression anymore but sometimes I still feel that there is some depression inside of me. But I’m no expert on this level.

Anyways my therapist helped me out of that phase and I felt better, like I have won the battle of my anxiety disorder. She sadly retired in March 2024. 

No fast forward to June 2024. My Boyfriend gave us another chance (even though he said that Hawaii was our last long vacation together). We went to to NY and Canada and even planned to go to Aruba. But on the drive to Toronto it suddenly started again. I tried to calm myself down and used what I have learned in Therapy. But that wouldn’t work out. I had the courage to tell my boyfriend that I might be having an anxiety attack. Of course our vacation was ruined afterwards. We made it through Canada but cancelled Aruba and went home before even trying to get to Aruba. 

I went to therapy afterwards again because I haven’t been in therapy since the retirement of my therapist. 

Don’t understand me wrong. He is understandable about my anxiety disorder, but since he had problems with ex-partners who also had mental health problems, like depression and other things. He loves me and I love him too. 

Now today on the 31. of January we were planning to go on vacation again. Tomorrow we would have both flown together from Paris to NY and then to Puerto Rico. It was more of a spontaneous trip because we still had Jet Blue Tickets to spend. Everything went well until this morning. Yesterday everything went quite well and even the last weeks I didn’t feel such anxiety. 
It might have been that I was unsure about the trip and had thoughts about having an anxiety attacks and ruining our vacation again. Now this morning I suddenly started feeling unwell. Like out of the blue. 
I’m still on my regular medication which my first therapist prescribed but my other therapist prescribed me XANAX just for emergencies. 
I used that XANAX pill and felt better. We were in the train on the way to Paris but as we arrived in Paris I started thinking what would be better. Fighting on against my Fears and not letting these fears control me again like they did last time, while it means that I have to suffer. Or do I call it off and go home but let him fly so he can enjoy a good vacation. 

In the end I called it off and he is now flying alone to Puerto Rico. Now I feel mixed emotions. Like regretting my decisions, but also feeling better, I guess? xD I don’t know but while he is away I spent the time at my parents home, so he can be assured I won’t be doing stupid stuff that might end up in no good things. He feels better and assured with that as when I’m alone at home.

The Good Bye was very hurtful and I really cried because I miss him so much. But I also want the best for him so that’s why I decided to call my part of vacation off. He also felt pain letting me go. But I guess that’s what it is. My thought was for him to finally have a peaceful Vacation and enjoy it, because the last two years weren’t really much enjoying and relaxing. He is the type of guy that can relax more when He’s far away. I might be more of a home person. I don’t really know to be honest. 

I really want to go on vacation and see the world. So far I’ve only been to the US and that’s it. But because of my university and studies I should be doing (or it would be better if I did) a semester in Japan. I also want to be able to go on vacation again with him.

I know I might not be alone out there, but are there any other people who have this kind of anxiety or stress when going on vacation? Or did anyone else suffer from this problem? If so, what did you do? And if you are in a relationship, what do you do?

Do you have any Advice? ",1,2025-01-31 19:41:09,2,1.0,IamPokoli
anxiety,1ielu5d,So anxious I physically cannot urinate,"So lately my anxiety and depression have gone through the roof and I have been struggling intensely since November. I was even hospitalized for a time as well due to suicidal intent. At this point, the only thing I can think about is suicide despite doing every possible thing I can to distract myself or cope (I do breathing exercises, visualization coupled with aromatherapy, journaling, magnesium glycinate, l-theanine, prescribed medications, externalization, therapy, and more). I find myself so anxious lately that I either vomit, have digestive issues including constipation and diahearra, and most concerningly, I cannot pee. I guess I’ve been so tense that I cannot relax enough to pee. I have to go so bad, but when I sit down I have to take 20 to 30 mins just to urinate. It is awful. I hate the thought of drinking liquids so much that it repulses me. I drink probably a two liter of liquid a day despite this, but I hate it. So much.

anxiety,1ieku2w,Feeling stuck in molasses,"I’m having a hard time describing my biggest anxiety related issue to my therapist and therefore have been unable to make any progress on fixing it. Could you help me describe this feeling / sensory issue?

I’ll get overwhelmed by a bunch of little things and it’ll turn into this big overarching feeling that sticks everything together so it feels impossible to fix any of it. 
Example:
My hands are too cold
It’s too loud where I am 
I have to tell my partner to handle a chore (which I loathe doing) 
I get a ping from my phone about a text I need to respond to

Suddenly, my whole body feels too slow. I can’t type fast enough to respond to the text. I can’t move quick enough to leave the room that’s loud. I can’t focus on telling my partner the chord because I can’t form words in my brain. Every part of me is stuck in molasses, physically and mentally. I will get immediately overwhelmed and frustrated so I need to be totally alone and try to focus on my breathing until I can separate the bad things. 

The biggest issue of it all is I constantly feel about 2 things away from going into this ‘stuck’ mode. I am constantly barely away from the edge of a cliff of overwhelming myself. 

I think my therapist focuses on the “oh you’re stressed so that’s why you’re easily getting overwhelmed “ but not understanding it physically feels like my body slows down. My reactions are so slow compared to how fast my brain is moving but unable to form words- just a billion feelings at once. ",1,2025-01-31 18:57:40,0,1.0,PissedEnvironmental

just anything any advice i would appreciate

i still dont get y this isnt enough for me and my body and my mind to be grateful for this essence of time and chance to work on my health and ‘fix’ some of the issues ive been experiencing.

 I also have a lot of anticipatory anxiety around my final final exams at the end of med school which is a good 4 years away from me but idk why my brain is worrying about somethung so far in the future when i have yet to deal with the present hurdles (ie getting through 2nd year when i go back)

i get my course is intense but everyone else is still doing it regardless. Ik others are stressed but theyre still able to move forward. me feeling like this and crying and feeling utter rubbish isnt going to help. i know i need to take heed of my situation and just move forward regardless of my struggles but its just so hard when ur body and mind just feel so weak. I just feel so useless at times and wish id get better and that i get my mental strength back. ive never struggled this much before and it scares me so much at times that i dont feel in control of my emotions or anything

anxiety,1iejw03,Advice/help anyone with similar debilitating anxiety?,"I’ve struggled with depression for years and developed anxiety about two years ago. I would get panic attacks and episodes where I felt like I couldn’t breathe, but nothing severe enough to seek medical help. My parents were very anti-therapy and anti-psychiatry, so I wasn’t able to get professional help until I became a legal adult.

In April of last year, my father passed away. A few months later, I had a panic attack while out with friends, and after that, I developed agoraphobia. Every time I left my house, I would experience extreme anxiety and panic, making it difficult to function. I ignored it for a while, but eventually, I went to a psychiatrist. She prescribed Prozac, but I put off taking it for three months.

Then, on January 11th (or 12th/13th), I had a severe panic attack after exercising, which sent me to the hospital. I was shaking for two hours. That experience pushed me to finally start taking Prozac (10 mg). The first five days were fine—I felt more like myself, could leave the house, and still had anxiety but nothing unbearable.

However, on the fifth day, I had a horrible panic attack. The next day, I woke up feeling completely out of it—detached from reality, with severe anxiety and heart palpitations. Ever since that day, my anxiety has been relentless. Out of fear, I stopped taking Prozac for three days, but my psychiatrist put me back on it. Restarting it was awful—intense dissociation, nausea, loss of appetite, shakiness, waking up anxious, and struggling to sleep. Things improved slightly, but recently, I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night and feeling exhausted all day.

For context, I also take 0.25 mg of Xanax twice a day (once for sleep and once during the day) because my anxiety is so debilitating. At my last appointment, my psychiatrist added Risperidone (0.25 mg at bedtime), but I’m not sure what it’s supposed to do. I took it last night and didn’t notice much difference. She also increased my Prozac dose to 20 mg, but I’m scared it’ll make everything worse.

As of today, I’ve been on Prozac for 15 days. I feel hopeless, unmotivated, and exhausted. I miss my old self and don’t know if I should continue, increase the dose, or ask to switch medications. I know it’s still early, but does anyone have personal experience with this? Does it get better? I feel like my anxiety is consuming my life, and I’m terrified that I won’t improve.

Sorry if it’s messy, I just wanted to write, I hope I’m not bothering

I really often spend days / weeks alone in my flat, just watching YouTube videos, shorts, porn, whatever, eating bad things / not eating at all, doing nothing and hating myself for it
I found escapism in the urge of buying things. So I look about things to buy, dream about how my life would be so much better if I had this or this.. sometimes I buy it, knowing I have barely enough money to pay my rent. But then I just want more.

I know it’s bad because you romanticise the situations you don’t know, but I envy them. I really want to be a student, a worker.. Waking up in the morning, going to the same place everyday with the same people, making friends there..

I’m a musician, I’m about to sign a deal, music is the only thing I’ve known in my life. I feel like I’m losing my passion for music because of the pressure of being cool, consistent, stylish, and good.. listening to music close to mine makes me feel so fckin anxious now, bc it reminds me that I’m bad in comparison, and that I probably don’t even deserve to exist artistically, that I’m a joke.
And music is me, even more since I go on stage to sing, so when I think that, I think I’m shit & useless as a human too.
 I’m also feeling shitty for not enjoying my position, so it’s making it even worse. 
Sometimes, I’m really happy too. And it might be, to me, the worse of it. Because then it’s hard to follow / know what you really think, how you really feel. I can’t trust myself. 
I never make choices. In my relationship, my life, my ""career"".. I do my best to avoid needing to choose. The idea that the decision I’d make could be the wrong one is killing me, I’d rather let it flow even if sometimes it’s bad for me or anything.
I think i’m scared of decisions, ridicule, shame.
It’s also a ego question, because you want to be someone, you want to be the best friend, the best artist, the best person. The idea that i could be none of this is burning me inside, why would I do this then ? Why would I even live ?",2,2025-01-31 14:07:22,1,1.0,Boudaoul

Context

I've been dealing with a pretty traumatic recovery from a reconstructive surgery done on my jaw in late Oct, was misinformed/neglected in the lead up **(**ie false/reductive figures about mental risks involved, failure to acknowledge history of mental illness or poor self esteem.. >!with the excuse of 'you always seemed so friendly' :)))))))!!!!! :( !<**)** as well as intense discomfort, pains and dismissed anxiety/fear of complications post-op etc

I'm going 20 and have been varied severities of unwell for about 8 years now, recently diagnosed ADHD and in a somewhat stable place, but my decline after the surgery has been rapid, really intense, and different in ways I'm not equipped to cope with. 

I'm unable to work, function or emotionally regulate and as my (already weak) social circle dissolved when people went to Uni and moved on, I'm housebound and alone. My expectations *were* to be long-term travelling \~April time :/

I'm journalling, speaking to a clinical psychologist and councillor (both limited 6 sessions), and feel like I have access to this mountain of self help resources and I'm putting in SO much work, but still getting worse - and my coping strategies are disintegrating.

\-

Meds

My experience with SSRIs is bad, and I'm not looking to be dependant on any long term medication. Either way, after being advised to make an urgent call to talk about meds, their options were SSRIs or beta blockers - the latter coming across as a bandage solution to a relatively smaller part of the problem - so neither of which seemed right. This didn't matter, as my questions, stuttering and panic lead the on-duty GP to tell me to research and call again as he was 'backed up' with calls. Great. (we were talking for less than 20mins)

New day, new on-duty GP. After research it seemed options down the route of short term benzodiazepine might help pause or relieve spiralling mental state, sleep, help me leave the house/start to get better, all problems that sounded ignored by b-blockers, while still also helping with physical symptoms.. Apparently not?-

\-I'm very aware of the reasons to under prescribe and the NICE guidance etc. but I don't understand why my fear and severity of suffering has been assigned a half-proven, risk-associated (depression, insomnia..) heart medication. The risk in getting worse for the next however long seems worse. 

Yes, addressing the physical symptoms is a start, mind-body feedback loop.. yes yes etc, but I'm already doing everything for my wellbeing and am so worried about continuing to get worse as I'm already dealing with intrusive thoughts again. This was all mentioned to doc.. yet, I'm now trying to work up the strength to get to the pharmacy for my heart meds....

anxiety,1iedtn1,Surviving ADHD at 20: My Journey So Far,"

Turning 20 has made me reflect a lot on the journey I’ve had with ADHD. It hasn’t always been easy, and there were times I thought I’d never get through it. But here I am—thriving, learning, and embracing who I am with ADHD.

For years, it felt like my mind was always racing, bouncing from one thing to the next without a clear path. The constant struggle to stay focused, manage time, and keep up with responsibilities made me feel overwhelmed. But over time, I’ve discovered that ADHD doesn’t have to define me or hold me back.

In my 20s, I’ve learned to build routines that work for me. I use tools like planners and digital reminders to stay organized. I also give myself grace when things don’t go as planned. I’ve accepted that my brain works differently, and that’s okay.

Through therapy, medication, and surrounding myself with people who understand and support me, I’ve found ways to thrive. I’ve also learned to embrace the unique strengths that come with ADHD, like creativity, problem-solving, and hyper-focus on things I’m passionate about.

The biggest lesson? It’s all about balance. ADHD is part of who I am, but it doesn’t define me. I’m still learning and growing, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

If you're navigating ADHD, no matter your age, know that you're not alone. It’s a journey, but survival—and success—is possible.

anxiety,1ieg1rh,Anxiety symptoms returning?,"Hello!

A quick background on myself, I had a very bad anxiety attack 13 years ago in a Costco.  Dizziness, facial numbness, difficulty to breath, etc. 

I took Benadryl, drank a six pack of beer, drank an energy drink and smoked a pack of cigarettes. All coupled with no sleep the previous night. It’s probably what triggered it.

Thought I was having a stroke or heart attack but that wasn’t the case. Later to find it was a severe panic attack. 

After that, I essentially became a hermit. I got depressed, I was afraid to go out, couldn’t leave my room etc. All in the fear of experiencing another attack like that.

Eventually I just got tired of wasting my life so I got a retail job to get my mind off of it, met my girlfriend, started working out, stopped all my vices, exchanged a kombucha for an energy drink. 

I was finally happy, no symptoms came back. I felt like my old self again!

I was fine for like 10 years but I started drinking again (like 2 beers every 6 months), been drinking energy drinks daily, gained A LOT of weight (I’ve been going to the gym a bit but my diet sucks) still don’t smoke.

But just last week, I got a tooth pulled and I was prescribed 600mg of Motrin. I was fine for a few days but I couldn’t sleep one day. I woke up at midnight but I leave for work around 6AM. 

Went to work fine, I chugged a 12 oz Red Bull and took the Motrin but maybe 30 minutes later in my quiet office, I just got a familiar feeling. 

I was pacing around my workplace and wetting my face with cold water but the tingly facial numbness was essentially giving me a feedback loop into my brain.

I left work early for the day to center myself and to figure it out. 

When driving home, I kept dousing myself with cold water from a water bottle until I was soaked. I also was blasting the AC in my car. I don’t know, I was panicking and didn’t know what to do. 

I just slept it off for the day. 

I went to work the next few days and felt OK. A bit off but fine. But everyone I am alone or in the car, I get the tingly feeling in my face that just reminds me of anxiety. 

It’s been a few days and it’s still manifesting itself. 

I was prescribed 10mg Propanolol and Buspirone. I really don’t want to be reliant on medication, but I took the Propanolol and felt much better for a few hours. Then the numbness returned.

Honestly, I am so irritated at myself. I never should have chugged that energy drink! Now I feel like I am falling back to old patterns.",1,2025-01-31 15:31:06,0,1.0,thatoneasiankid90

Recently ive noticed mild dizziness that is sporadic and some lightheartedness. I typically notice this paired with being on a screen, not the TV, but a laptop or my phone. I have no other alarming symptoms everything I have read seems to say I have eye strain. Which makes sense due to it being related to the screen. My eyes do feel dry quite often, before this even began happening. I just got back to school after our break so that means I’ve also had stress. Added with that I’ve had a handful of anxiety attack-like events about this feeling that I wonder if it is adding to that feeling.

For more context im a twenty year old male, I’ve dealt with headaches for a while, like since I was 15 so I cannot associate that with my eyes because that has never gotten better or worse since then.

basically just asking if anyone has experienced anything similar. 

Deep down I know it’s nothing and is something that will pass within a month or so, I just need some reassurance.

anxiety,1iefnwy,How do I know it's anxiety and not just becoming aware of how things really are?,"While not yet diagnosed with GAD or any other anxiety-related disorder, I (M24) can see some changes in regards to how I see myself, my future, and the world. For as long as I can remember, I have been prone to having anxious thoughts, especially at bed time. Being diagnosed with ADHD at around age 10, I have always been experiencing tons of different thoughts, most of them are random and not anxiety-inducing though.

While I always had ""moments"" of feeling unwell, doubts about myself, my future etc. It occupied a small minority of my time and usually was not that intense. That's how I could notice these were outliers, ""glitches"" in my thinking, and nothing to really worry about long term.

Things changed about half a year ago, when I finally managed to move out from my parent's house, found a job in my field (SWE), and started living with my partner. Things went relatively smoothly, but becuase it was one of the most stressful episodes of my life, I believe it was the tipping point, from which my anxiety became like 90% of my life. I also cannot find hapiness in hobbies I had, nor in playing games I liked.

I am obsessively thinking about different topics, like (TW): >!health, safety, AI, the nature of existence, time, nuclear war, what's happening in the US rn (I live in the central Europe, but still it makes me scared)!<. The topics can also interact with each other, but having a break from them feels like a miracle.

My question is, as in the title, how do I know it's just my brain messing with me? Whan can I do to feel better long term? I have visited a psychiatrist a few times, we tried ADHD meds and vitamin D supplementation with no effect. I am looking for a CBT therapy in hopes it is going to help, but I have also times when I doubt anything's gonna help me.

anxiety,1iefnqt,Gas smell in apartment,"So I had a gas smell in my apartment last night, I started freaking out immediately because idk I have this fear of gas smells and explosions. I found out it was a car getting working on in the garage below us.

They calmed my fear a bit about anything exploding and said something to the guy working on his car downstairs and the guy left. I told my landlord and he was pissed because apparently he didn’t know they were using the garage to do car work so he said that would not be happening again. And so even though I knew last night and now this morning that we are no longer in danger, I still had a hard time falling asleep and had to keep repeating to myself we are safe.

anxiety,1ieb3sa,I feel like I AM anxiety.,"I had coffee today, and I was also triggered today.  

I keep repeating ""I'm good enough. I'm not responsible for my BFs emotions. I'm worth it. No one is mad at me,"" over and over in my head. 

I've been trying really hard to say these things so it will just reinforce it. Because I believe and feel the opposite. 

My boyfriend had a stressful day. He's a great guy, never yells, he's cried in my arms, he has an amazing relationship with his family. Genuinely a good person. 
But I grew up in an abusive home. Where I had to be responsible for the emotions of my parents. 

My dad would always tell me and my siblings ""it's your fault your mom is mad."" Every single time they fought. It was my fault and my brothers. 

So when my boyfriend, someone I love, is mad, I have so much anxiety. I need to fix it. I think of all the ways I have messed up in the last few months and I think of every way I'm not good enough so I can find what I did to make his day hard. Because I my mind, is not just his stressful job. It's his stressful job AND me that's making him mad. 

And you know what I cannot wrap my mind around? Someone can be mad at me and still love me, and talk to me, and that it doesn't mean they will leave. 

And I've been to therapy for this. And nothing has helped me deal with it. 

So if you have any advice. If you grew up in an angry house where people leave or ignored you when they were mad, how did you deal with it? How do you deal with it.

anxiety,1ieedy7,Mirtazapine or sertraline?,"Hi all,

I have been prescribed both mirtazapine and sertraline by my GP in the past year. I haven’t started taking either because I am not sure which would serve my situation better in the long term.

I haven’t incredibly intense anxiety around food and social eating. My previous post on this account describes the problem in detail.

If your symptoms are:
- waking up early shaking with anxiety
- intense morning nausea that often causes vomiting
- intense anxiety around meal times to the point where you avoid any event where you have to eat in front of others

What medication would make the most sense? I feel that Mirtazapine would benefit sleep and appetite immensely, however, from what I have heard SSRIs such as sertraline are more safe to take in the long term, and better at addressing actual anxiety. 

I can’t really tell if I have an ED or just an anxiety disorder because I experience intense anxiety about all sorts of things, but it only ever manifests itself in me worrying about food.

anxiety,1ied6tf,Anything? 😭,"I don’t know how to explain this or where to begin. I feel like I sound psychotic, or like I’m developing schizophrenia, and I just feel insane. I’ve seen my psychiatrist (within the last week), we’ve changed up my meds, but… I don’t know what’s happening to me or where to begin to figure it out or how to even explain it. 

Back in like 2017/2018, I started having weird “episodes” like very sporadically. It sounds crazy, but the only way I can describe it is - I remember something that has happened, kind of feel myself traveling through time (mentally) back to that place, what I can only describe as a flashback? I break out into a sweat immediately. I’m not really responsive or able to comprehend what’s happening. It only lasts a few seconds-moments, but it gives me a horrible feeling for the rest of the day. These episodes were VERY RARE and random.

Fast forward to last year. I started taking a GLP-1 a little over a year ago to lose weight. It was working, everything was fine. I’ve also been on psychiatric meds for a while (I can list if needed). I got pregnant, was taken off a couple of the meds including the GLP-1. I terminated shortly after.

The middle of summer last year, I started having seizures, for the first time in my life. I’ve only had two, but, I have no history of seizures. 

Ever since I’ve just had this ongoing on/off again feeling of just… dying. Horrible anxiety. Horrible dread. Dying. I woke up at 6am yesterday, took a shower because that’s my comfort place when I’m anxious, and got back in the bed with my boyfriend. Next thing I know, I’m awake and we’re having sex. I’m freaking the fuck out because I don’t remember waking up or agreeing to have sex. (I know for a fact that he didn’t do anything to me, morning sex for us is normal and we’ve been together for over a year, and he said I consented, and if I didn’t wanna have sex, I would’ve just said that, I’ve done so plenty of times.) And then I fell back asleep and woke up a few hours later and was just… completely confused. Didn’t remember shit. 

My memory is so messed up. My ability to figure out what’s going on with me, or how to even DESCRIBE it without sounding like a fucking lunatic, is messed up. I smoke weed and I wonder if that’s making things worse, so I’m tempted to quit even though I’ve been smoking for 15 years. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know how to fix this. I want to feel normal again. I can’t describe this feeling. It’s just intense, pure anxiety and doom and confusion and just the feeling that SOMETHING is fucking wrong, but I don’t know what… I don’t know what’s wrong. I don’t know who to turn to. I don’t know who I can say this to without sounding crazy and being put in a mental hospital. I don’t know what to do. ",1,2025-01-31 13:00:40,1,1.0,xokaybae

My guide is also not very sure as to how I might finish my thesis if at all I do, and since then I have been having insane anxiety attacks and haven't been able to get out of bed (the freeze response). 
I was supposed to meet my guide this week again, but I hadn't done my work because of the anxious-procrastination cycle and have had multiple breakdowns.

I got broken up with 3 months ago and it came out of nowhere for me. It knocked my confidence with some of the stuff she said, also made me realise how shit of a gf she actually was.

I've really worked hard on myself since, listening to self love breakup podcasts and throwing myself into the gym. I've started dating again and been seeing someone for the last 3 weeks.

My confidence seems to peak some weeks/days and then like justnow, I'm feeling pretty low and anxious. My friends are pretty jokey and some of the jokes they make can hurt quite a bit. They've kinda always been like this but recently it feels like the jokes have upped and im not sure if they mean them.

Last night they told me im socially inept and said it seriously. It feels like ive become easy pickings in the group and i dont know how to reverse that?

My life is actually pretty good. I'm financially years ahead of my peers - I have a property worth £230k (60k equity), £30k in savings, £40k in my pension and earning £50k as a software dev. I'm in the best shape I've ever been in, 6'2 and pretty decent looking and everyone apart from my friend group says i come across super confident and smart.

anxiety,1ie99xa,Supplements…..might be helping,"Hey all,

So I’m pretty f****d in the head. Depressed out of my mind, feel like the world is going to come crashing down on me. You all know the drill.

I’ve tried pretty much every anti anxiety med sans benzos which I’m afraid to take because they’re highly addictive and *so* am I. Nothing seemed to help. Mirtazapine is the only thing that helped decently (especially with sleep, shit knocked me out) but it basically killed *every* emotion. Can’t feel anxious/depressed when you can’t feel at all? Right? I didn’t like that.

So, I decided to go the homeopathic route because it can’t be *completely* full of shit, or can it? Idk. I googled anti anxiety supplements and basically started taking them all. 

Here’s the list: Ashwagandha, NAC, Valerian Root, B complex plus standalone B1, Magnesium, L-Theanine, a multivitamin, and before bed Benadryl and melatonin. 

My panic attacks have mostly gone away, but what has completely gone away is the tightness in my chest I get every time I have a negative thought/memory (which is all the time). The negative thoughts have decreased I’d say, but they’re still there. Oh and my pee is neon green all the time which is cool.

Maybe it’s all placebo and I’m f*****g up my liver with all these expensive supplements, or maybe they are actually working, idk. It’s only been a week-and-a-half ish so we’ll see if it gets better or stays the same.

anxiety,1iebwzx,My medication journey is about to begin and I'm kinda scared.,"TL;DR: I'm starting on medication for severe anxiety and OCD after dealing with it for around 15 years - and I'm scared.

Sooo - I've dealt with severe anxiety and OCD (currently very contamination based, at least that's the most debilitating part of it) and have mainly gone to therapy or dealt with it myself. It's been back and forth and now at 25, it's like everything in me just decided thatci just can't do it anymore - I'm not gonna fix this myself.

I've been to the doctor and a psychiatrist and been told to start medication. I've never been told this before and so I've build up this feeling and mentality that meds were NOT for me and that I COULD fix this on my own. 

And now I can't. I'm so bound to my apartment and can't be or go anywhere. I'm soo fuckinf close to dropping out of my beloved education (filmschool, so I'll likely never got accepted in again since that proces is tough) and I feel like I've isolated from everyone I know. I can't do this anymore. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of me. And honestly, a part of me can't wait to get some medication - yet it still makes me want to piss my pants...

I'm mainly scared of two things;
1) side effects.
2) that it just doesn't work - because then what?

My brother has tried different meds for both depression, anxiety and OCD and had some pretty bad side effects, that basically is the root cause of how my anxiety started. I'm scared that I'll react like him but I'm also scared of feeling empty inside. My brain is chaotic - which right now is a mess for me - but usually that's one of my strengths as a creative. But I'm scared that it'll make me so empty that I can't even be that anymore.

And then if it doesn't work - then what? Then I'll have nothing else to help me and that scares me.

I guess I'm just ranting but also looking to bear other people's experiences. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna take 'setralin' - have anyone tried that and how did it help or affect you?",1,2025-01-31 11:32:50,3,1.0,DoubtfullButOkay

As I now know it could possibly just be anxiety I still overthink, I can’t sleep. My brain keeps telling me I won’t make it if I fall asleep.

anxiety,1idvvqp,"Does anyone else get panic attacks around eating, especially when they get the slightest bit of indigestion?","I used to get panic attacks purely because I was worried of anxiety turning into a panic attack but since I threw up as a result of eating before a panic attack, now there is an extra fear around panic attacks because I know they will eventually result in me throwing up if I don't get it under control. 

Every meal is now a struggle for me because the slightest bit of indigestion caused me to start getting really anxious.  

Just want to know if anyone else feels like this as I'm eating less and less.  

I started taking medication for migraines which had a side effect of helping my anxiety, to the point the panic attacks completely went, triggers wouldn't impact me at all. It was amazing, I had a life for a year. It had been so long since I felt that sense of normality.  But I think I must have developed a tolerance because now it's all come back with a vengance.  It's funny, I really started taking it for granted that I had my life back and was still dissatisfied with other small things, which is crazy when you consider how torturous it is in the moment of panic attacks and how you'd give everything to have them taken away. 

My girlfriend is finding it hard to support me and might well leave me because it's much much harder to eat with others around.  She barely speaks to me now because she thinks I'm avoiding her when in fact I'm just scared of anxiety.

And honestly I wanna stop taking pills in general because I’m tired of trying new pills and I feel like being dependent on pills is not gonna solve the problems that create my anxiety and depression in the first place.

I had just seen her a couple of months before and everything was fine. She gave me a referral to see a psychiatrist and I had a time finding the right one. Was diagnosed with GAD and everyone just wanted to prescribe meds until I found an Integrative psychiatrist. She prescribed meds, but also told me to take magnesium and l theanine. Within 2 days of just taking the supplements, my head is clear, I’m at ease, and the physical symptoms are almost completely gone. 

Went to specialist for lab work and had to ASK for full tests. Turns out my magnesium and iron was low. Culprit. This should be checked before suggesting someone has a ongoing mental illness.

I don't if anyone else experiences this- when I'm sitting infront of other people in class or sometimes just in general, when a loud or unexpected noise is made or a word (an uncomfortable/ awkward one) is mentioned my neck will tremble or twitch and sometimes my torso does the same. Never happens when I'm alone though. On-top of that in classroom settings I get super tense and my back begins to hurt 😐.

In 2022 I suffered for 6 weeks with back pain that was misdiagnosed 3 times as UTIs and even an STD. one morning I woke up unable to pee shaking. Turns out it was kidney stones stuck in my ureter. Passed those and fine.

Everything I read says if you’re peeing that’s good because it means the kidneys are working.

(yes to an extent,  but not everyone reacts the *same.* ) he wouldn't write DAW for teva. but he did in the past for other medications. so i don't understand. so basically, is there anyway i can call my insurance and see if they can essentially prior authorize it themselves? i've explained to my dr all the reasonings as described above and didn't show a care which is odd bc he usually tries to help me out as much as possible. what about amazon? i'm on medicaid and i believe they don't accept medicaid. but i do see that i can prob afford the generic for teva on there i believe it's $18 for mine which i'm willing to pay ",1,2025-01-31 06:27:13,5,1.0,mini-peewee

OKAY, she told me she’ll discuss my symptoms and stuff with my psychiatrist and they’ll get back to me. (I told her I didn’t like Effexor) sooo after that first appt with her I never got a call back but I got a notification from the pharmacy saying I had 3 prescriptions, so I picked it up, I honestly didn’t know what I was buying, I thought it would’ve been something like another SSRI. But it was abilify.. I googled that when I got home, and it’s an antipsychotic.. she also prescribed me buspirone & clonazepam (which I like the clonazepam) but I cannot take all this stuff together. I researched clonazepam and buspirone and it has interactions and why would she prescribe ambilify?

I'm losing my mind here and just wondering if anybody shares these crazy symptoms with me?

I have had anxiety on and off all my life, it has manifestes as panic attacks, agoraphobia, health anxiety and my latest is the weirdest physical symptoms (if indeed this is all anxiety?).

My body feels very stiff, I feel off balance and as if I have lost the ability to walk. If I have to stand still I get brain surges. I feel as if I have a balloon inside me that is being blown up. I get burning hot flushes/cold flushes, sweating in weird places. I feel as if all the nerves in my body are raw, like an electric feeling, tingling, pins and needles, shortness of breath, tachycardia...I could go on and on. It's honestly awful, but due to a very severe reaction I had to a medication some years ago, I don't want to take anything. 

Every minute of every day is pure hell and I'm weighing up whether to quit my job because I can't manage, but I don't seem to be much better when at home chillin.

anxiety,1ie2ca3,did you know? also is it true?,"i read this only about how social media helps anxiety if your not over using then i wouldn’t use it: 

Social media can positively impact mental health when used in a way that builds connection, expression, and awareness. 
Connection
Build relationships

Social media can help people connect with friends, family, and others who share interests. 

Reduce loneliness
Social media can help people feel less lonely, especially when face-to-face interaction is difficult. 
Find a community
Social media can help people find a community of people who accept them and their identities. 


do you agree? if you search this it should pop up on the internet and you can read more (correct me if i’m wrong about my post but plz be nice) as long as your not over using social media to the part where it makes you depressed and have anxiety then i don’t recommend this. but if your on it and it doesn’t make u feel that way. let me know if social media has helped you in this way? let me know and plz no hate thank you’",2,2025-01-31 01:39:24,4,1.0,lalauvte

anxiety,1ie5p74,Constant Anxiety,"I think I may have some sort of anxiety disorder or some type of ptsd.
Whenever I hear a noise downstairs whether it's loud or just kinda a brief noise that is undisclosed, I think my mom fell and is hurt or dying and get anxiety. This causes anxiety first thing in the morning and nearly daily from random sounds downstairs. Then whenever my mom and stepdad argue I think stepdad is gonna kill/hurt her or she's gonna kill/hurt him or something and get anxiety. Even my mom saying a word in a certain tone can give me anxiety.


I believe this is just any type of arguing, not just my parents because I was on FaceTime call with my cousin and he had left then he and his father ended up arguing and I got anxiety and thought he might get hurt, so I ended up hanging up.

I'll often be watching something on my phone etc and I hear a noise so l'll pause my phone and listen closely for anymore sounds, I'll do this for arguing and noises, listening to see if I should be worried though I’ll be regardless. I also just get easily startled by loud noises and get random bouts of mild anxiety for seemingly no reason.

anxiety,1ie136o,Some encouragement.,"I had very bad anxiety for years, for months at a time I felt a permanent feeling if adrenaline. I was reacting to everything on the spot and not making normal decisions, like just not having the space to think about things first. I couldn't even watch TV or play video games, never mind almost never sleeping properly. Perhaps that makes sense to some of you. 

I'm lucky enough that I had access to a psych and I jumped at the opportunity. Long story short, after many sessions and eventually going on SSRIs I'm in control again and happier than I've been since I can remember. This past month my aunt passed away and a friend and colleague had a heart attack (he's alright thankfully) and I had 8 hours of stressful meetings today - which is a trigger because I'm socially anxious. During all of those events I've been mostly in control of the anxiety and still quite happy in general when I get home. 

I just wanted to remind anyone here that nothing you are feeling needs to be permanent, which is something I definitely did not believe at some point. ",2,2025-01-31 00:40:10,0,1.0,sub_terrain
anxiety,1ie5hvr,Is this normal or should I look into this?,"I know this subreddit isn’t used to give out diagnoses but I was hoping I could get a general idea about what’s wrong with me, and if anyone can help me figure out what I should do.

So right now I feel nervous all the time and whenever I think of doing anything I feel a weird nervous feeling in my chest. This can be caused from literally anything that requires me to take an action; getting out of bed, putting something on to watch, going to shower, going to make food etc. I don’t feel it when talking to people unless they’re new and I usually don’t feel it when I’m out with others. I always feel stopped whenever I try to do anything and it feels like I sometimes just can’t do it. I’ve tried to force myself to do things and not run away from the feeling but it has never improved, and it feels terrible trying to do anything.

Idk if this’ll help but I’ll give some context. 
I think this was triggered by events of last year when I used to put a lot of pressure on myself to do well in uni, while also trying to juggle a relationship and friends. I started getting constant headaches that never went away. From the moment I woke up to the moment I slept. Then one day during an argument with my ex, i felt a deep sharp pain through my heart. It hurt to breathe and I  felt a pain running down my neck. This would happen every so often for about two week. One time it was so bad that I felt like I couldn’t stand at all without feeling like I would collapse. Eventually it went away and the doctors said it was likely heartburn. Then towards the end of the year, I felt manic. I felt pressured by everything from uni to my relationship, I still had the headaches, and I felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t do or focus on anything at all. I was convinced I needed to break off my relationship just to feel normal. The manic sort of behaviour stopped but everything else is still happening to a lesser degree. The main thing that’s affecting me now is that nervous feeling and inability to focus.

Does this sound like anxiety or is this somewhat normal?

anxiety,1idzcgc,Shaking a LOT,"This has been happening to me for years but I never started really ""noticing"" it until lately because it's been happening a lot. Ive been stressed lately. Whenever I get anxious or overwhelmed with stress, I start having shaking/tremors that I can feel mostly in my chest and arms but also in my legs as well. So basically my entire body, lol. But especially my torso (but not so much in my hands?) I don't know how to describe it. It comes in waves. I wanna say it feels like a seizure, but I've never had a seizure. It basically just feels like I'm being seized by tremors for a few seconds and then it stops. Then the cycle repeats until I can distract myself or rest.

anxiety,1ie44rq,Is this anxiety?,"Okay so im a teenager and i really really need help there’s a few things that have been happening over the last few months and i just need to get this out to someone. Okay so theres a lot of things thats been happening to me. Okay so i was okay then all of a sudden one day i started to think about throwing up and i started to gag and after this i kinda just shrugged it off as a weird occurrence. Then that went away and didn’t happen for a while. Okay so do you ever think about breathing and then you’ll have to breathe manually for a little bit, so that happened and i brushed it off as it would go away but it didn’t and it’s been going on for like a month at this point obviously there’s some points at time where it’ll go away for a little bit but then i’ll think “hey im not breathing manually” and it’ll come back. The third thing that happened is whenever i put a shirt on i’ll think about it chocking me and gag this can also happen with hoodies necklaces that i have so sometimes ill have to sit there and pull my collar of my shirt/hoodie just to not cough and gag. Okay so another thing that happened is There’s this girl i’ve been talking to for a while with the intention to date and one day i was like what if i lose feelings and ever since i like over analayzs everything and i’ll be like “why am i not constantly thinking about this person” but the thing is when i talk to her she makes me smile and laugh and i enjoy hanging out with her. Okay the last thing is ive been thinking lately about my future and college because that’s the next chapter of my life and something i can’t stop thinking about is once you get a job your life is pretty much over it’s just job eat sleep repeat and it’s all i can think about the last week or so.

anxiety,1ie3wpy,Constant Ups and Downs are Exhausting,"I have been suffering from some really bad anxiety over the past few days. It's very discouraging because I had been doing really well. For the past two weeks, I have been consistently taking care of my hygiene and my diet, and attending to things like school and my bills. These are things that are almost impossible when both my anxiety and depression are hitting at the same time and for a long time I had given up on the possibility of being able to do more than the absolute bare minimum. I was feeling a lot better, and in a way that felt reasonable enough that I had hope (even if I was skeptical) that it might a sign of a more long-term shift, especially since my medications were recently adjusted. 

On Sunday, everything fell apart in the span of a couple hours. I woke up feeling fine and by the evening, I could feel that all the progress I thought I had made was out the window. I have massive anxiety and OCD symptoms about the climate and the political state of the US, and previously, I was searching about politics for maybe thirty minutes a day and never about the climate. For weeks, I was telling my providers that I was having no OCD symptoms at all, and now they are worse than they have been in over a year. Yesterday, I woke up at 7am and continuously searched about these topics for the next four hours. I went from a relatively decent mood to crying constantly. I have gone back to the 'what's the point' attitude that I had previously and now it's almost impossible to do anything. I am desperately trying to maintain the progress I made, but I know that at least some of it will have to be forgotten because I can barely get out of bed. 

This has become a cycle, and it's completing exhausting. I just recently got out of a major period of depression, only to get on new medication and improve for a couple weeks. Then back to depression and suicidal thoughts for two weeks, then back to improving in the last two weeks. I experienced this a lot back in my senior year of high school (I am almost 21 now), where I would have a couple weeks of being normal and then spiral into a period of barely functioning. The medication I've been on since then mostly stopped this cycling, but it caused a lot of weight gain and made me not really care about anything at all or make any attempt to be better. I am off it now but am on a lower dose of a similar medication. 

If I increase my dose, I am afraid I will go back to not caring and sleepwalking through life, but at the same time, I feel like not caring was the only thing keeping me even remotely sane. Suddenly experiencing this very painful cycle again is making me wonder if attempting to change my medication or attempting to be better at all was even worth it. Making progress is almost worse than not functioning when every time I get close to improving, everything falls apart and I'm right back to square one. I am not sure where to go from here and how to make plans for my future considering I have barely made it through the last eight years of my life and am continuing to find new lows yearly.",0,2025-01-31 02:55:46,0,0.5,Zealousideal_Ball401
anxiety,1ie3ut5,Evil butterflies,"Hey y’all, I’m 21M and have panic disorder with agoraphobia. I wanted to ask if any of you experience this similar symptom. It feels like heat rising from your pelvic area, feeling like lava bubbling up through your intestines and then staying there. I call it evil butterflies, (I even made a little graphic of it to visualize the sensation to show my girlfriend lol) because it’s in the same spot as the “butterflies in your stomach” feeling would be. It usually precedes a panic attack, like right before, either triggered by a trauma smell or a conscious or unconscious thought. But other times it can just, happen on its own for no apparent reason and I can brush it off. I’m currently on medication rn (Prozac) my dose was recently increased, and I’m somewhat still in the stabilization phase however I have noticed a decrease in panic attacks and their severity and random physical symptoms. Anyways I digress, anyone else call it evil butterflies and can relate?

anxiety,1ie3rpj,How do yall drink alcohol without panicking and feeling like you’re going to die?,"As a college student, all of my friends party occasionally or etc - just as a lot of college kids do. Before I got severe anxiety and panic attacks, I was able to party with my friends on weekends without the worry of drinking or anything. Even in last spring, I was perfectly fine besides from my panic attacks that were separate from drinking. 

I recently stopped taking Lexapro on accident (I couldn’t get my script refilled) about 2.5-3 weeks ago. When I last drank on Lexapro, about a month ago, I had a horrible hangover the next day because I accidentally took it too far with drinking the night before. 

Not being able to party with my friends and live life makes me feel left out and sad. I feel sad because I feel like I’m missing out on doing the things they’re doing with them, and I feel like somethings wrong with me that I can’t enjoy things like they can. It makes me sad to see all my friends having fun, living with no worries, being able to drink and party and etc and have no worry that for some reason I’m just going to die. 

I’ve been proven time and time again that nothing bad has happened while I have drank or partied. Now, I just in the past six months started worrying about drinking. “Is it gonna kill me?” “Is it gonna give me a panic attack, then lead to a panic attack, then I’ll die?” “What if I immediately dehydrate and have to go to the hospital?” Once I convinced myself that by having a single beer I was going to get a tumor. I spent the rest of the night worrying intensely and crying. I think these things then I spiral, even though none of my friends are doing this and assure me I’m fine. 

I tend to be the type of anxious where I really thing every sensation or small ache/pain/anything is something more major. A small pain in my head immediately insinuates that I have brain cancer or al going to have a stroke. 

I guess I just want to be able to do all the things with my friends that they do. When I’m sitting on the couch and they’re all taking shots together or planning stuff, or just in their own non-anxious world, I feel so alone. 

Has anyone found a way that allows them to somewhat drink without intense worrying? Sometimes, once I start drinking a bit I realize I’m fine, but it’s the initial worrisome buildup. I don’t have a therapist at the moment because I’m having a hard time finding one in network with my new insurance. 

I guess I just want to be normal like everyone else and do the mundane things I shouldn’t have to intensely worry about unless I had reasoning or was overdoing it. Sorry for long post but thank you for reading",1,2025-01-31 02:49:33,19,1.0,disgustingnewspaper

anxiety,1ie38t8,rabies anxiety 🦇,"here we go again with the rabies anxiety… I’m sorry yall 😭

I’ve been checking like crazy for bats around my house even though there’s practically no way one could get in. I’ve been dealing with some crazy dry skin/eczema and I think it’s what been causing a “bite” type of feeling on my skin and my anxiety convinced me “omg that was a bat that just bit you”

It’s causing me to search everywhere for a bat to be lingering or just chilling out just waiting to bite me. Or checking my legs and arms and all over my body for a bite that doesn’t exist.

This isn’t how I want to spend my days, I just want to be happy again and break out of the anxiety OCD loop I’ve been trapped in for months straight now. 

Why do I have to worry about if a bat bit me or if a bat is hiding in my clothes or in my seat or in my bed and going to bite me in my sleep or bite me and I won’t notice (somehow…?) and I’ll die painfully and brutally from rabies. It’s like a countdown in my head to my anxiety until my “”inevitable”” downfall from rabies (that’s how my anxiety sees it atleast).

I’ve tried delaying compulsions of searching for bats and checking for bites but with the dry skin causing the sensation of biting all over my body it keeps freaking me out like “THIS IS IT!!!! BAT ALERT!!! RABIES, IMMEDIATELY!”
It’s like my anxiety is seeing little bats as some evil creature that’s just waiting to bite me. Rubbing its hands together maliciously “mwahah. Soon….” Is what the bats are saying. Lol.

How do I cope? Has anyone else dealt with this, and what helped you cope and get past this?

So now I get scared socializing. Well I returned to work today and it was so awkward. I was trying to crack jokes but they just came out as stressed out and too serious sounding. Like, I jokingly tried telling my boss ""I don't need you to help me"" (he's cool like that, you can joke around with him like that lol) and I think I was mostly successful but it came out strained, so I almost sounded serious saying it. Like I meant it. 

Then there was the weird faces. I tried being normal but the anxiety strained my face and made me make weird faces instead of normal ones.

Worst part is, this is all unpredictable. Usually I'm confident around people. But here and there this sort of extreme awkwardness strikes, and it's completely unpredictable. This time around, it was more predictable that I was gonna be awkward because of the fact that I didn't work for four months and therefore knew I'd be nervous going back. But sometimes I get like this in times of when i'm confident! Do you see why I avoid people altogether? It's like a gamble, this random awkwardness.",1,2025-01-31 02:16:40,0,1.0,DryCoast

I avoid going back to the ED because they just label me “anxiety” and kick me out the door and never want to treat me. I’m really conflicted and not doing good mentally and idk what to do anymore. Idk if I should go to the ER and demand a closer look or just thug it out like I’ve been doing and wait for my endoscopy in gah dang April and suffer for the next three ish months.

anxiety,1ie30wr,Anxiety/ panic attacks help,"Hello, so when I was younger I used to have really bad panic attacks and anxiety. It has since gone away but 3 days ago I went to sleep and woke up about a hour later and my mind felt really weird and then I started to have a panic attack but the main symptom is shaking/tremors and jolts. I used a hot shower and that helped me calm down but it was really bad. Then again I woke up about 30 min after I went to sleep and woke up and then it started again mainly just shaking and tremors very bad with shivering/teeth clicking. I did research and leaned I should just allow it to happen and then pretend to make it worse. So last night again I woke up about 2 hours after falling asleep, my brain felt weird like I had no control of my thoughts or something very weird. And I used this strategy when the attack started and it went away within 5ish mins without needing to get a shower or anything I was able to lay in bed and wait it out. So I am getting better at controlling it but has anyone else experience this? The main symptom being tremors/shaking? Also has anyone else experienced panic attacks shortly after falling asleep?

anxiety,1idy0j2,So ... I took an edible back in October.,"Sorry in advance this might be a little bit of a rambly mess.

Yep back in October I (28 m) did take an edible 20 mg indica. Now for most people you would think it would calm you down help you relax sadly for me the opposite was true. I'll spare the details of the trip itself because quite frankly it's not as relevant to me anymore... at least mostly... However since that day I have been dealing with pretty outrageous anxiety and panic attacks. Though to be fair the panic attacks have significantly decreased in frequency, I do still have incredibly rough moments of anxiety. I've had anxiety in the past but it's to the point that I am not able to sleep at all unless I am like so deprived that my body forces it upon me which I pray for, and I'm not religious. My subconscious will actively fight sleep by keeping my brain going a mile a minute. I am actively going through therapy. I saw a psychiatrist last week, they even put me on prazosin which so far doesn't seem to be doing anything for me other than causing my heart to race at 1:00 a.m.

I am going through life as best as I can on little sleep. The anxiety isn't so frequent but it does tend to come and go in waves. For example... Today I was sitting at my desk trying my hand at meditation just to try and be more mindful. I was fine beforehand and then suddenly I felt it. That familiar tingle in my chest, shoulders, neck and arms. I tried to think of what possibly it could have triggered it, and then my stomach growled. That's when I realized.... I messed myself up so bad and scared myself so much with that stupid edible, that my brain is throwing panic and anxiety signals over the simple fact that I was hungry. When I realized that, It broke me.

 I feel so bad that I did this to myself. I know the hard part of ""healing"" from a trauma is understanding that I'm not supposed to beat myself up over it but sometimes I can't help it. It is a grieving process. The past me is gone and I have to accept that there is no going back and changing the past is impossible. I am trying to look forward and think positively. Especially since the reality of the situation is, I am actually taking steps in my life that I should have taken years ago, to help me be a better person to myself and other people around me. I'm taking care of my health which has been something I've been neglecting for years, and I'm being more social. I had pretty nasty social anxiety and this experience, as crazy as it sounds, actually made me get over that (mostly). 

I am still struggling with health anxiety, and insomnia. I've read some pretty great things in this subreddit that while it's great advice it's not easy. I will keep at it and share this story here because I guess this also kind of helps me cope.",2,2025-01-30 22:26:31,2,1.0,KingstonLeWolf

I have had terrible morning anxiety. And this week it has been loud and clear due to starting school again. I haven’t had much trouble going to sleep at all (thank god), but waking up I already feel on edge, anxious about the day ahead 

Today I had class. So from 7-11 am I was off and on in my head, thinking about the fact that I am anxious, how am I going to handle this right now, what if I go home in feel worse? As you can tell i spiraled, and gave these thoughts attention 

So by the time I get home I’m in PANIC. Took hydroxyzine (1st time in a year). Then took a nap, and I feel revived😭 not only am I calm but I feel happier 

Looking back on today, I feel like some of these things I did to myself. Like yes I know I have anxiety, but I added fuel to the fire. There are things I could’ve done but didn’t (such as reframing my thinking)

I have an appointment with my NP next week and I was looking into meds that could help with my anxiety. I’m currently on 40mg of Prozac and 0.25mg of Clonazepam as needed (though I only really take a half of one maybe every other day). 

I saw a lot of people talking about Propranolol on here and I was wondering if anybody had any experience with it and if you think it would help me? I struggle mostly with physical anxiety (upset stomach, vomiting, heart racing, lightheadedness, shaking, etc.) and the clonazepam helps to an extent but it makes me more sleepy than I would like. I am a nursing student and I can’t really afford to be drowsy while I’m at clinical placement or in class.

So in the new year eve , i got invited to my friends friend house i drank two glaces of gin and than started to smoke weed , after taking 4 puffs the first 30 min was so chill we were listening to music i was laughing and dancing , and then suddenly i grabbed my head and i started acting crazy , i started to grind my teeth and then when i closed my eyes i saw visual effects and the sound of music was getting higher in a scary way 
So i went to my friend grabbed her hand and started to tell her that i dont feel okay , all of the sudden i felt the stops and this is the moment i will die , my heart started to beat really fast and i started to panic , so i told my friend to take me to the bathroom so i can wash my face , and here i started to question about my whole existence, is what’s happening to me real ? Am i real ? 
And i started to see my friends in double , and here their voice repeating which made me feel that another me from another universe is trying to steel me body from this universe and i should fight it 
And than i started to shake really bad , and i tried everything to make it feel less 
I threw up , i drank water , i saw myself in the mirror but nothing changed 
And than my friend helped me to lay down on the bed but i wasn’t sure what is going on per exemple if i open my eyes i see my friend talks to me and if i close my eyes i see that she is sleeping next to me and holding my hands , so i wasn’t sure which one to believe 
This feeling lasted for 4 hours till i slept and didn’t feel anything till the morning 

1 week after this experience I felt like im not real and this world is not real so i was still paranoid 

But i told myself I shouldn’t be scared of weed 

So i tried for the second time , oh boy it was a disaster but this time with people i dont really know in their house 
Like everytime the first 30 minutes was so good , a lot of laughs and fun 
But i remember showing them a video of me , after they saw the video they started to laugh non stop and they were saying to each other to not laugh about me it’s bad , which made me really uncomfortable 
And then they started to ask me about if im sad in my life or not 
And here I panicked, i thought they drugged me or sum and they are trying to make something bad to me even tho we smoke from the same joint 
So i told them i will go to my house i dont feel comfortable 

At my house i didn’t believe that im at my house , i was thinking that im passed out at their house and this is all a dream 
And each time i throw up or eat or hear some sounds i tell myself this is happening in the real life in their house and im stuck in this dream 
And i felt my brain is trying to play some tricks with me 

This feeling lasts for 9 hours non stop

But after that all what i felt is still there is discomfort in my chest and feeling my thighs are heavy or numb 
So i need some advices 
I dont want those affects to last for too long , i dont want to be anxious and paranoid for the rest of my life 

Because each time im having dreams that really scares me , so some of the nights I can’t even sleep from the fear 
One time i had a dream and there was a lot of screaming so i wake up , but here is the trick i woke up bu still in the dream 
When i woke up i saw that im in the house laying ok my bed and trying to call my mom because i was scared from the dream and once i get up out of the bad i passed out and i thought i died

Thus I almost feel like I’m chemically induced sociopath - (without wanting to harm anyone:,)
However I can remember what things I used to feel empathy for as before this condition I was a very sensitive empathic person - it still makes it very hard in relationships relating to people as much as I try because I can’t verbalise empathy in any way even in writting❤️

anxiety,1ie212k,Panic attacks only when trying to fall asleep-help?,"I just wanted to share what I’ve been going through recently and see if anyone could relate..

For context, I’m 17

Lately, I’ve been trying to become more self-aware and gain a better understanding of things, and part of that journey involved experimenting with psychedelics. I had positive experiences with shrooms and LSD in the past, so one day, on a whim, I decided to take them again.

Big mistake. At first, I felt pretty anxious, but I managed to push through it and actually ended up enjoying the rest of my day.

However, I noticed this lingering sense of anxiety that just wouldn’t go away. I started fixating on it, and that night, when I tried to sleep, I had my first (and worst) panic attack ever. It lasted about an hour—nothing felt real, and I was convinced I was losing my mind. It was pure hell.

That was about a month ago, and ever since, it feels like I’ve developed some kind of trauma response. Every time I lay down to sleep, I get stuck in this cycle of battling my own thoughts, trying not to “go insane.” Sometimes, I can manage it, but other times, I end up having another panic attack.

It’s exhausting not being able to fall asleep peacefully. I’m an extreme overthinker, and I feel trapped in this feedback loop: I can’t talk myself out of the anxiety because I’m hyper-aware of trying to do so, which only makes it worse. But if I try to accept it, I start overanalyzing whether I’m truly accepting it or still resisting, which just fuels more anxiety.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on how to break this cycle?

anxiety,1ie1u37,How do you like to deal with panic attack hangover?,"I’ve gotten better at bringing myself down from an anxiety attack before it leads to a full blown panic attack but when it happens, the anxiety, fatigue, and emptiness afterwards makes me want to just crawl into bed and sleep so I don’t have to be awake to experience it.

anxiety,1ie1qu6,Lexapro Questions,"Hello, new here! I was recently diagnosed with GAD and was prescribed lexapro to help combat it. I have been taking it for roughly a week now and the adjustment to the medication has really been taking a toll on me. My psychiatrist warned me that the first couple weeks would be hard, that I’d feel a bit nauseous and maybe feel drowsy during the day too. However, it’s been worse than I imagined. I feel like I have zero appetite, every time I try to eat I can only get a few bites down before I start to feel full and nauseous. I’ve hardly slept since taking the medicine and have been spending my nights tossing and turning while lying awake. I feel weak and tired and sick pretty much constantly due to all of this. She also told me it could take 4-6 weeks to really feel the effects, but if anything, I feel like my anxiety has gotten worse since getting diagnosed. 
My question is, does this sound common for starting lexapro? I see my psychiatrist again in about a month and if this strikes anyone as abnormal, I don’t really want to put up with it for another month until we meet again. Hoping for some advice, if this sounds normal and like it’ll get better with a bit more time, or if this sounds like a bad sign and I should reach out to the psychiatrist sooner rather than waiting.

My BP is all over the place when it’s measured (usually with one of those automatic readers). 

I am seeing a midwife as the care they provide is better for someone with anxiety. They are extremely supportive, calming and kind. My blood pressure has been in the normal range with them and they take it on one of those manual cuffs.

However, they know I still struggle a ton with health anxiety and getting my blood pressure measured. So they referred me to a perinatal psychiatrist to help me with coping strategies or maybe even to prescribe something to take before appointments. But I have an appointment with one next week and I am terrified. 

The part I am most terrified about is if they will require to take my BP. I know I have the right to refuse and they can’t legally force me. But will he refuse to see me because I won’t let them take my blood pressure? Again, this causes me immense anxiety and could lead to a terrible spiral lasting weeks or months.

I have struggled with stress, high stress and anxiety for a good 15 years. 

Currently having a bad period. My anxiety and stress manifests a lot with physical symptoms. I have heart palpitations and tightness in chest. I know that my cortisol levels are chronically of the roof.

I have been in doctor from time to time. I go to therapy. I am now decided to keep trying. Get out of this mess.

But then I have started to get some weird sensations in my eyes. Small blinking white light in the corner of my eye a few times a day.

That spirals me to think that I have ruined my health. All this stress have developed something serious. Brain cancer, neurodisease. Something. 

And then the spiral just deepens. Scared to go to doctor but I guess I need to.

Anyway, how are people dealing with these kind of fears? Anyone who is on the same boat?

anxiety,1idv4ja,Half Life Prozac,"
Hi all, 

I will start by saying I have an appt with my psychiatrist on Monday so I plan on asking him this same question but wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience:

I took 20mg of Prozac for 33 days, felt like 5-10% better while taking it but was experiencing the sexual side effects. So I stopped taking it (confirmed with doctor this was okay), then 2 days later I felt 100% better (like barely any depression or anxiety) and that lasted for ~10 days. But I’m back to square 1 and that 100% feeling is gone. Is it possible that Prozac was still in my system for those 10 days since it has a long half life? And I stopped it just as it was starting to work?

Thanks for any responses I really appreciate it",1,2025-01-30 20:25:17,2,1.0,AntiqueRub1256
anxiety,1iduz8l,"Has anyone heard the song, Chained to the Rhythm by Katy Perry?","This song, while often interpreted as a commentary on corporate greed, also resonates deeply with the experience of mental health struggles.  The lyrics about being ""chained to the rhythm"" can be a powerful metaphor for how we become trapped in patterns, particularly when it comes to stress.  We all create our own rhythms, and it's crucial to examine whether those rhythms are serving us. Are we cultivating a sense of inner peace, or are we stuck in a cycle of anxiety and stress?  Our brains are naturally drawn to rhythm, and the habits we develop, especially as coping mechanisms, become the rhythms that define our lives.

Too often, we're so caught up in the stress itself that we don't even realize the unhealthy rhythm we've created. This disconnection can be devastating, causing us to miss out on so much of life. I understand this firsthand. After a severe car accident and TBI, I lived with constant stress for 23 years.  My brain's perception of reality became distorted, and I felt completely disconnected from my own body.  Unintentionally, I treated others poorly, and I lost all motivation.  I hadn't properly addressed my rehabilitation needs.

However, since January 2024, I've been incorporating deep breathing exercises into my daily routine, and the impact has been profound.  These exercises have helped me reconnect with my body and begin to rebuild my relationship with reality.  It's been a process, and I'm still on my journey, but I'm making progress every day.  Developing healthier coping mechanisms is an ongoing effort, but even when things feel bleak, there is always hope.

I encourage everyone to take a close look at the rhythms they're creating in their lives.  When stress arises, what is your immediate response?  Is it a healthy response?  Do you like the outcome of your current coping strategies? If not, it's time to explore and develop healthier alternatives.  Here are a few additional tips:

* **Mindfulness:**  Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, allowing you to recognize unhealthy patterns as they emerge. Even a few minutes of daily mindfulness can make a difference.

* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  Dealing with stress is challenging, and it's important to avoid self-criticism.  Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend struggling with similar issues.

* **Seek Support:** Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional for support.  Talking about your struggles can be incredibly helpful.

* **Physical Activity:**  Exercise is a powerful stress reliever.  Even a short walk can help clear your head and improve your mood.

* **Healthy Habits:** Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and hydration.  These basic needs play a significant role in your overall well-being and your ability to manage stress.

* **Professional Guidance:** If you're struggling to manage stress on your own, consider seeking professional help.  A therapist or counselor can provide you with tools and strategies to cope more effectively.  They can also help you address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your stress.

anxiety,1idpa6x,Breaking Free,"The weight of the past clung to Flor like a heavy fog, thick and unrelenting. Even though she had stepped away, the presence of the place, their eyes, their judgment, their control, lingered in her mind, whispering doubts and threats that never quite left. It wasn’t just a memory; it felt like a shadow that followed her, waiting to pull her back in.

She walked through the dim corridor of her thoughts, every step echoing with the paranoia they had instilled in her. The feeling of being watched, of being judged, of never being quite good enough. They had built walls around her, ones that didn’t crumble just because she left.

But then, something changed.

A force, gentle but firm, stepped into the space beside her. A presence that wasn’t them. It didn’t suffocate. It didn’t demand. It simply existed, a quiet assurance that she wasn’t alone.

“Flor,” it said, voice steady like an anchor in a storm. “You don’t belong to them anymore.”

She turned, unsure at first if she could trust the voice. “Then why do they still feel so close?” she asked.

“Because fear lingers longer than chains. But fear is not a cage. It’s a ghost. And ghosts only have power when you believe in them.”

Flor clenched her fists. She wanted to believe that. She needed to.

The presence lifted a hand, and suddenly, the corridor around her cracked. The walls that once loomed over her, the ones built from micromanagement and control, split open like shattered glass. Beyond them, a vast sky stretched wide and endless, open and free. The weight on her chest eased, the grip on her mind loosened.

“They don’t own you,” the voice said again, firmer now. “They never did.”

Flor hesitated for only a moment before she stepped forward, away from the ruins of what once held her. The ground beneath her feet felt solid, hers.

And when she looked back, expecting to see their looming presence, she saw nothing but dust. The past was no longer a monster. Just fragments of something that had tried to break her but failed.

With a deep breath, Flor faced forward. The world stretched before her, full of paths she hadn’t yet walked, full of possibilities that weren’t dictated by someone else’s control.

And then she did something she hadn’t done in a long time.

She smiled.

anxiety,1idty2q,"Mysterious Head Spinning/Jolting Sensation – Very worried, Looking for Insight","Hi everyone, I’ve been experiencing something scary over the past few months, and I’m hoping someone might relate or have insight.

I’ve had three episodes of a strange, brief (1–3 seconds) internal head-spinning/jolting sensation. It doesn’t feel like typical vertigo, where the world spins—this is more like a sudden sensation *inside* my head.

**First Two Episodes:**

* Happened while I was sitting still on my bed, looking at my computer screen. 
* It felt like someone suddenly pushed my head to one side (jolt from right to left side), followed by a quick spinning/dropping sensation inside my head. 
* It was so sudden that it shocked me and made me gasp.

**Most Recent (and Scariest) Episode:**

* I was lying in bed reading, head propped up with a pillow.
* Started dozing off, then moved slightly to put my book away.
* Suddenly felt a sort of numbness/loss of control on the left side of my head, followed by a head rush feeling localized in the back bottom left of my head and internal spinning sensation. I genuinely thought something bad was about to happen in my brain.
* Again, it lasted just a few seconds, but it was terrifying.

# Other Symptoms & Possible Connections:

* I struggle with sinus issues (frequent infections, sinus pressure & pain, clogged ears).
* In recent years, I’ve been getting pressure headaches that might be from stress/anxiety or lingering sinus inflammation.
* I also have anxiety, which sometimes gives me weird bodily sensations, but this feels different.
* I’ve looked into BPPV, but people usually describe the world spinning around them and seeing the world moving, while my issue is just an internal feeling in my head.

# Why I’m Posting:

I don’t have the resources to see doctors or get extensive testing right now, so I’m trying to figure out what this could be. Has anyone experienced something similar? Could this be ear/sinus-related, neurological, circulatory, or something else? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated! I'm very freaked out.",1,2025-01-30 19:36:43,1,1.0,Key-Inspector7217

anxiety,1idspbn,I'm lost,"*TW: Financial issues, heavy worrying, uncertain future, long post*

The past 7 months have been weighing on me a lot.

I’ve been working in customer service since 2019, after two years of struggling with depression/anxiety following my high school graduation. I finally wanted to find a stimulating and viable career, so I quit my retail job (that had become quite toxic) back in June 2024 with the goal of pursuing studies. This required a lot of courage, as I have always experienced high fear/anxiety towards going back to school. For my studies, I chose animal care because I found that I really enjoy learning about animals and ensuring their well-being. I had saved up enough money in order to support myself and be able to take the summer months as vacation.

Unfortunately, things did not work out as well as I had hoped. I made it into the school program, but because of miscommunication regarding payment, my spot was cancelled with no way of getting it back. It was given to another student on the waiting list.

In the meantime, many things happened that made life harder, little by little. During a medical appointment, I asked to lessen my antidepressant dose to eventually stop it altogether. I thought I was “ready”, but it actually made me feel worse over time and even affected my romantic relationship… I got back to my original dosage after three months, but I was left with the impression I haven’t exactly been the same since.

Then, I started noticing I had allergic reactions and more asthma attacks than usual. They were triggered by my pets and general house dust, which isn’t exactly useful when wanting to work among animals… So this ended up crushing my career plans.

Moreover, our rent would have a major increase planned for December. I was already hesitating and worrying about studying when I didn’t have any income, so I applied for jobs. For the record, I live with my mom and my sister, both of which are unemployed (my mom has been in burnout since 2024 and my sister is still in school and aiming to obtain her diploma soon.) I might have ended up applying for a part-time job if I had gotten into the program, but I would’ve preferred not to because of my mental health.

So, I luckily landed a very interesting job for November. It was seemingly perfect for me ; almost completely remote, 30h a week, Monday through Friday with one required Saturday every month, relatively good pay for my education level and amazing benefits.

The problem is that I barely lasted a week.

I got completely consumed by anxiety. It was panic attacks after panic attacks. Non-stop crying. The workplace and the people were not at fault at all, the coworkers were very friendly and supportive… but I just wanted to run away every minute. Seeing the tasks I was going to have to do worried me much more than anticipated, my role made me feel so uneasy. Was I really fit for the job? Was I going to enjoy myself after the first months? Everything was new, too new, and I was extremely afraid.

I “celebrated” my 25th birthday the very same week I dropped the job from being unable to overcome my anxiety. I felt like a complete failure and I still do, along with regrets.

Here we are, almost in February 2025. Desperately looking for a job I can handle, completely clueless as to where I should go. I feel so low, my family feels so low, I spiral down frequently because of my thoughts. I am lost.

My only dream career has always been art since I was very young. I feel so very happy when drawing, when creating for myself and others. But knowing how difficult the market is, how unstable the job can be and with AI art complicating things… I feel like I could never pull it off. It would be extra income only.

So it looks like I can only work exploitative retail jobs and stay miserable.

One day, I’d love to live with my boyfriend and be able to support myself enough so that he doesn’t have to for me. But looking at my life so far, he’s concerned about if we could ever pull it off, as much as he wants us to.

Everything hurts so much.

If any of you have some advice, want to share a similar experience or even just encouraging words, please do.

anxiety,1idsotc,I think i have Separation Anxiety and I am trying to get better,"Hello there,

I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction with this one. I'm not too sure if i am describing it correctly or if it will make sense.

For the past 2 years i have been, in what i could call, the relationship i have always wanted with the person i always wanted. This woman and I have known each other from the ages of 12 and our paths finally crossed again back at the end of 2022.

Long story short, we fell so deeply in love due to us both liking each other all the way back then and it immediately felt right. She is my twin, in a female version. Soulmate and the rest. 

It really is amazing to love someone to this extent. The only problem I find, is that when i'm not with her, my mood really changes. Or if she announces she is staying home for the night or 2, it instantly bums me out. Now i do want to make clear, i understand everybody needs their own time to themselves and especially when they have a lot going on, outside of the relationship.

So i have tried to understand why these mood changes come and why i feel so down without her around. I came across Separation Anxiety and it really stood out to me and explained most of the things i have felt throughout life. Its a lot of trauma from childhood which has lingered in the background into adulthood due to several different factors.

I never have anger towards her for wanting the time to herself but i can understand how the mood change could come across in a way. I never have the fear of if she is doing something wrong or if something bad has happened to her. Its just an immense feeling of missing her and wanting to be next to her. 

I do feel as if part of it is due to how much i liked her in childhood, whilst going through the problems i was, and now being able to be with her and intensified my feelings and so forth as I haven't felt like this or noticed it as much in previous relationships. 

I really don't like feeling like this and especially adding an extra stress towards the person i truly love, i want to be better and want to find myself to be okay without her for a day or 2. It sounds silly when i type it out and i hope i am not judged for it. Its never been in a malicious intent. Its also quite annoying, having to deal with these issues as an adult and makes me feel quite low. 

I know solving childhood traumas will take probably a life time of learning to cope and deal with, but I really don't want it to get in the way of being able love correctly or not too hard. 

So i guess my question is, has any one experienced this or also received the same thing before themselves. How do you navigate it and are they any techniques? I would love to know.

Thank you.",1,2025-01-30 18:44:39,2,1.0,Important-Usual7658

anxiety,1idrqbd,scared of being poisoned,"hey guys. recently i’ve been scared of getting poisoned by drugs like lsd, weed, dmt. literally any drug you can think of. it started when i was at my bfs house alone bc he went on a trip and i was just gonna have a drink to calm my nerves. well, i poured like the tiniest amount of vodka in a glass w cranberry juice. like i could not even taste the vodka - that’s all small amount it was. 
well, after 3 sips i just got very lightheaded, hot, dizzy, shaky, and dissociating. i am pretty sure it was laced, but my bf said he didn’t do that but it might’ve been one of his friends from awhile ago. the vodka was in the freezer and it was almost two years old he said. so i think it was laced with weed or something. my eyes were red, which rarely happens when i drink. and obviously i know what being drunk feels like & it wasn’t that. i’ve smoke weed before, and that’s exactly how i felt. i stopped smoking weed bc of that reason bc i would just get bad panic attacks. so i think it was weed, which is why it has been scaring me. 
this happened right after christmas like the 26th. and since then, i have been extremely scared to eat or drink anything specifically from grocery stores, ordering out, or restaurants. no matter how hard i try to rationalize it, it doesn’t work. i will have my bf or friends try my food before i consume it, but i still get scared. i do have diagnosed anxiety, but i’ve never had this issue before. my friend thinks it’s OCD. also, i do have a family history of schizophrenia, ocd, anxiety, and psychosis. anyone know what to do? im really struggling, its causing me to not eat, or even brush my teeth bc im scared my toothbrush or paste somehow got poisoned. my whole brain is consumed by this and its making me feel crazy. so anyone know what it is or what to do? please. 

( i am also scared of taking meds too bc i am scared then that will be poisoned as well, but i do want help)

anxiety,1idrp72,struggling with anxiety in college,"hi everyone! i am a college freshman who just started my second semester a couple of weeks ago. for context: i have always struggled with anxiety, but never really got panic attacks very often, am diagnosed with GAD, and have been on zoloft for a little over a year, with another SSRI for a while before that. i would love to be in therapy but it’s hard to find someone as i go to school out of state. 

slightly before my winter break i started having episodes of intense panic— nausea, dizziness, chest tightening feeling, etc, just in general feeling like i was going to die and or pass out— when i tried to go to class. i had a couple sessions with a school counselor and i was prescribed propanalol. basically as soon as i started taking the meds before class my symptoms really decreased and i felt pretty normal and was able to go to class. 

fast forward to now, the episodes are back, but it’s more a constant heightened feeling of dread and anxiety rather than only isolated episodes, and the propanalol has basically stopped working. i’ve missed a lot of class already and i’m working with my university’s disability services to try and get accommodations so the absences don’t seriously affect my grades, which obviously would be great but won’t make the anxiety go away. this is really affecting my general quality of life— not only am i missing class but i’m also constantly exhausted, nauseous, just totally mentally spent. 

so TLDR, any tips for managing these feelings/episodes, especially in a classroom setting where usual grounding techniques (music, etc) wouldn’t really be possible? apologies for the long post and thank you all so much :) ",1,2025-01-30 18:03:56,0,0.99,No-Evening524
anxiety,1id9b0n,My “journey” through anxiety recovery,"If just one person benefits from this post, then it was well worth the couple hours I spent typing this out…😅

I’m a 29M, and my anxiety “journey” started in December 2022. I’d had anxious moments before—usually after smoking weed, being deathly hungover (Sunday scaries), or under heavy stress—but they never stuck around. Once the panic passed, I moved on. Until one day, I couldn’t.

At 26, my life was kind of a mess. I had left a great sales job to start my own business, which didn’t work out, and ended up broke, waiting tables, drinking too much, sleeping around, staying up late, eating like shit, and skipping the gym. Then, one night at work, it happened. I was working a private event when I thought, “Shit, it’s pretty loud in here.” Within minutes, I was lightheaded, short of breath, and drowning in an overwhelming sense of doom—textbook panic attack. But I had no fucking clue why.

From then on, the attacks came harder and more often. What started as random panic spiraled into an all-day, never-ending, soul-crushing anxiety. I went through every wild thought imaginable—heart attack, brain tumor, psychotic break, losing touch with reality. One week, I was terrified I was going insane. The next, I obsessed over existence, death, the afterlife, eternity, nothingness, God, the universe. My brain would not shut up. And I was too scared to tell anyone—not because I was alone (I have plenty of friends and family) but because I feared they’d confirm what I dreaded most: that I was actually losing it.

Anxiety became my obsession. I’d wake up and immediately check if it was still there—if that scary thought was still rattling around, if that awful feeling still had its claws in me. I was a fucking dork constantly checking my pulse and breathing patterns. I’d spend hours on Reddit and WebMD (what an idiot). I’d read about mental illnesses that left me with a pit in my stomach and convinced I was doomed.

I tried everything to fix myself—working out, quitting drinking, cutting nicotine, going keto, meditating, breathwork, therapy, supplements, teas. I was desperate for a magic cure. And for a while, some things helped. I’d go a few days feeling normal and think, “Holy shit, I’m free!” But then the anxiety would come roaring back, and I’d spiral all over again.

The real breakthrough came when I stopped trying to “fight” anxiety and started accepting it. After reading all the self-help books and Reddit posts and listening to a million podcasts, I found “Disordered” by Josh Fletcher and Drew Linsalata. These guys were a Godsend for me. They drilled in the idea of “willful tolerance”—stop running from anxiety because that just makes it worse. So I slowly had an attitude shift toward, “Fuck it, if this is my life now, so be it.”

I practiced what they preached, and my mindset started shifting. “What if I go crazy?” became “Then let’s fucking go crazy.” “What if I have a heart attack?” turned into “Alright, guess I’m gonna have a heart attack then.” All the “What if’s” and existential questions that tortured me slowly started to quiet down when I answered “K.” to them. Now this wasn’t instant, and it wasn’t easy, but little by little, it worked. My anxiety went from consuming 95% of my day to 75%, then 50%, then 25%. 

Eventually, I had whole days and sometimes even a week without it. And when it did return, I didn’t panic. I didn’t spend the rest of the week ruminating and anticipating the next “episode”. I had the tools to handle it.

Fast forward to 2025—I still get anxious from time to time, but I don’t let it ravage me. I’d rate my anxiety at a 3/10 on average, with the occasional sprinkle of a 10/10 day, but I bounce back waaaaaay faster. More importantly, I started focusing on what actually matters—love, connection, faith. I learned to love myself which gave me the ability to love my amazing girlfriend. I learned about God’s love for us and started on my faith walk. I opened up to people about all the shit I’d been through. Now, most days, I honestly feel great. Not perfect. But great nonetheless. 

Looking back, I can’t believe I have my life back. Anxiety doesn’t consume my world anymore. Those thoughts that used to terrify me and send me in a spiral are just silly to me now. It’s just some background noise I don’t give a shit about. If it creeps up I say, “Bring it on” and keep it pushing. 
So if you’re deep in it right now, please trust me—you will get through this. You will recover. It’s possible. Do not give up. Hit me up if you’re struggling. 

TL;DR – Struggled with anxiety for two years. Tried everything. Slowly recovered through acceptance. Found love. Found God. Life is fucking awesome now. Talk to me.

anxiety,1idr1eu,First post / Blood pressure,"Hi everyone 29M turning 30 tomorrow  ! This is my first post here but I’ve been on Reddit for a while 

I was diagnosed with high BP about 2 months ago, 
and also got some blood work done that showed a bit of a fatty liver. Since then I’ve stopped drinking completely, drinking would always make me smoke a few cigarette so I stopped that too (I’m French btw, everyone smokes over here it’s insane)

My high BP could go up to 16/9 or 15/9 when I’m really stressed out, and back down to 13/8 when I’ve been reassured by my doctor that I don’t have anything very worrying. 
New blood work came back practically perfect after having stopped alcohol for one month, so that’s good I guess !

My 78 year old dad also got afib recently and that made me go down into a spiral of being scared for him, and also reading so much about afib that I thought I was going to get it too. Some days I could even use the ""FibriCheck"" app like 50 times, but it never detected anything.

Went to see my doctor and he told me I need to really calm down because I asked him to prescribe me an ECG, he still did it but told me it would just feed into my anxiety. I’m a very anxious person btw, can have small panic attacks if I just imagine somethings gonna happen to me any minute. I know it sounds crazy !

Anyways, should I get the ECG done ? My doctor says that if I start doing this I will never stop, and he’s kind of right, as soon as he calmed me down about my heart I started thinking I should check my lungs or my brain, it never ends 😂

Sorry for the long post, it actually feels good to right this down. I love reading posts on this sub because I feel like I’m not alone ❤️

I can be so logical and say ""okay I stare at a screen all day, I don't drink as much water as I should, I grind my teeth and I oversleep too much"" but my anxiety is like lol don't matter.
I work in a hospital surrounded by patients with cancer. Love my job until I think too much about it and then freak out lol. Anyway, I've had some weird headaches lately. Right side near my temple and above my eyebrow. Pain doesn't last long and it's only every so often. I also have this feeling in my brain that it's ""heavy"" and just feels weird. So of course, I panic. There's so many different things that could cause this feeling but I'm stuck on a brain tumor. I went to eye doctor for routine check up 2 months ago and they didn't mention anything. At my physical 6 months ago nothing was mentioned. And earlier this month, I went and got checked for a sinus infection but also straight up told them I think I have a brain tumor. Needless to say, I had a sinus infection and I was actually feeling pretty good for a bit. But now 2 weeks after stopping the antibiotics I feel back in that trance. I have a deviated septum so getting sinuses infections are common, but this temple headache just doesn't feel like one to me. I literally have no other symptoms; no speech issues or vision issues. Just the head stuff. My friends that are nurses say they'd bet their life on me not having one- so I feel like I can trust them with that.
I'm just having a lot of anxiety and I know I'm surrounded by it every day but I just can't shake this. I watch videos on brain tumors, google stuff, etc. I also refuse to get an MRI out of fear this will be true. UGH",7,2025-01-30 06:39:39,10,1.0,JustJessJennings01

anxiety,1idp4qm,Yoga/Meditation Before or After Breakfast for Anxiety/Stress? (Conflicting Info!),"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to optimize my morning routine to help manage my anxiety and stress. Currently, I do 45 minutes of yoga followed by 30 minutes of meditation after breakfast. However, I've been reading that practicing before breakfast might be better for mental health, so I wanted to get your thoughts and experiences.

My main priority is reducing anxiety and stress. Physical health is less of a concern for me right now, I really want to focus on improving my mental well-being.

I understand there are some potential benefits to practicing before breakfast:

* **Lowering cortisol:** Apparently, we have a cortisol spike in the morning, and yoga/meditation could help regulate that, leading to a calmer day.
* **Blood sugar:** Some sources say it can help stabilize blood sugar, which might reduce anxiety.
* **Mindfulness:** Starting the day with intention and mindfulness sounds really appealing.
* **Routine:** It could help create a more consistent morning routine, which I know is important for mental health.
* **Parasympathetic activation:** This is the ""rest and digest"" mode, which sounds great for calming anxiety.

**BUT** I also found this study (link to the study: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/eating-pattern-characterised-by-skipped-or-delayed-breakfast-is-associated-with-mood-disorders-among-an-australian-adult-cohort/5575751177845559555F955448A08846](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fcore%2Fjournals%2Fpsychological-medicine%2Farticle%2Feating-pattern-characterised-by-skipped-or-delayed-breakfast-is-associated-with-mood-disorders-among-an-australian-adult-cohort%2F5575751177845559555F955448A08846)) that strongly suggests delaying breakfast (which I'd be doing by about 90 minutes) is linked to a higher risk of mood disorders. The study even found a bidirectional relationship, meaning anxiety/mood issues could lead to later eating, and later eating could worsen mood. It makes me wonder if the benefits of practicing before breakfast would be canceled out by the negative effects of delaying my meal.

So, I'm a bit torn! Has anyone here experimented with both approaches? Did you notice a difference in your anxiety and stress levels? Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated, especially if you've dealt with similar mental health concerns.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1,2025-01-30 16:13:21,1,1.0,greentea387

I try to reach out, but it never feels like enough. The conversations feel shallow, the connections fleeting. I don’t know how to bridge the gap between myself and the world. It’s like I’m stuck in this endless cycle of wanting to be seen but never truly feeling like I am.

anxiety,1idoxgm,Let me share my story as I'm more demotivated than ever...,"See let me clarify first, I am M15. I don’t know what to say. And maybe that’s the saddest part of all.

Today, I walked into a class for something—just a simple meeting, nothing grand, nothing extraordinary. But behind my back, they whispered, they laughed, they branded me with a label I never asked for. “Gay,” they called me. And I tell you, it wasn’t the word itself that stung. It was the way they said it—the mockery, the sneers, the sheer pleasure they took in tearing me down. You’d think a heart like mine would be made of stone by now, but it isn’t. No, sir. It’s still as breakable as a windowpane in a hailstorm. And today, it shattered again. Now, don’t get me wrong. I know what they’ll say—“Be mature, ignore them, rise above it.” And by all means, I would, if I could. But let me tell you something about the back of a man’s heart. It’s where the truth lives, and my truth is this—I am insecure as hell. I am short. But I think—no, I hope—I look good too. And yet, when words like these are thrown at me, I start questioning everything. If they’re right, then what am I? A short, strange-looking outcast with no real friends, no respect, no chance at love? A walking target for betrayal? I know I shouldn’t be so damned pessimistic, but you have to understand—when you’ve spent enough nights talking yourself out of the dark, you start to wonder if there’s any light left at all.

I do it all myself. Every time I fall, I pull myself up. There’s no hand to reach for me, no arms to wrap around me and say, “It’s okay, you’re not alone.” No reassurance, no comfort, just me and my own reflection in the mirror, trying to convince myself that I’m enough. And I swear, some days, it’s the hardest battle I ever fight.

This world is not fair to me. But I know—I know—I’m not the only one. There are others, just like me, stumbling through the same storm, looking for shelter in a world that would rather throw stones. And I keep thinking, the answer to all this misery—it has to be love, doesn’t it? Love is the most powerful thing a man can give, and yet, we hoard it like gold and spend our time throwing dirt instead. Why? Why do people choose to hate when love is right there, waiting to be given?

I don’t have the power to change them. Not today, not tomorrow, maybe not ever. But damn it, it hurts to be overlooked. To be unseen, unheard. I tell myself I don’t need their validation, but the truth? The truth is, every man needs a little kindness, a little encouragement, a little proof that he matters. And yet, they won’t stop for me. They won’t acknowledge me. They won’t admit that maybe, just maybe, I’ve got something good inside of me.

And maybe—just maybe—they’ll finally admit it when I’m gone. But tell me, what’s the use then? What’s the good in being loved when you’re no longer there to feel it? Couldn’t you—just for once—do it now? While I’m still here, dying for a little kindness?",1,2025-01-30 16:03:58,1,1.0,Anra517951

My mom was living in different countries throughout my whole life. My grandma is 82 years old and I moved out a year ago with my fiancé because of some mental stuff she was going through such as accusing my fiancé of stealing etc etc (typical dementia stuff). She is much better now because she’s taking pills. I’ve been visiting her every day since I moved out. Sometimes twice a day.

Now about my mom. I visited her couple times in different countries but it was always so stressful. She has problems with depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol. Plus she has 2 daughters (my half sisters) that also give her hell. There was always some problems in her life that I didn’t wanna be apart of, but sometimes was forced to. She recently decided to come back here because after all these years in different country he says she has nothing, has some debts and needs a new start. I’m okay with that as she said she will help with taking care of grandma. 
She’s been like 3 weeks here and was already wasted twice. Once to a point I had to stay all night at the house because I felt like I had to protect my grandma. When my mom doesn’t drink she does A LOT around the house. Really, she cleans, cooks, goes shopping etc. 

Here’s the thing. I once managed to win over the anxiety once she was abroad but now she came back and my anxiety is through the roof. I keep thinking something’s wrong or she’ll get drunk. I keep feeling like I have to raise her and my grandma, I project what kind of feelings they might have, put them on myself and just feel so overwhelmed. It’s like I’m living their life instead of my own.
I keep waiting for a phone call that something’s wrong. My heart is about to blow out of my chest ever day very evening. I was at the house there today and I felt like the vibe was tough. Turns out my mom and her mom (my grandma) got into a little fight and I’m scared it’s gonna turn into my mom getting drunk and yelling and screaming. I keep imagining those scenarios. 
In all this mess, I think I’m too attached to my grandma. I keep imagining herself vaulnerable, sad and regretful etc. I keep seeing it in my head even tho both of them say I shouldn’t be nervous and not to think about it and don’t worry because it’s gonna be good. But it’s just talking. I’m so done. I am so… so tired. Mentally and physically. It’s like having kids and being on alert 24/7 putting myself in a hero position where I have to work everything out for them.
My grandma has 2 more kids, my aunt and my uncle and I don’t understand how they are just not as involved in all this. It’s like they can’t feel what they feel or something. 

I don’t think I can go any longer without some pills. I just don’t know how to stop living their life and trying to fix their problems themselves. How to stop trying to control the situation all the time and having my happiness being depended on their happiness. Please help. 

It’s like every day I’m anxious until I know everything with my mom and grandma is okay. Unfortunately my mom keeps drinking every few days.

It’s been a month now, and nothing has changed—I feel anxious all day, every day. And even though my colleagues are really nice, I can’t stand the working hours (9:00–17:30).


My husband tells me to quit; he can support both of us. But I feel like a failure and hate my mind for betraying me like this.


What would you do? Would you quit or try to stay? Thank you all for any advice and support. This sucks, but it’s good to know we’re in it together.

I am worried about my kids health, whenever they got sick I am so down, I can’t sleep or eat, I have palpitations, tightness in chest, I cry out of blue. They have just recovered from flu and I am still checking their temperature every couple hours. Now I am freaking out about the avian flu, a few weeks ago I was freaking out that our own indoor cat has rabies. I can’t function, I am afraid to take them into public transport, or any potentially crowded places.

when my severe anxiety first started years ago, i was a freshman in college and i completely failed one entire semester because of how scared i was and how new and unfamiliar all the symptoms were that i ended up never going to class and just staying home all the time because i only found comfort in my bed. 

now that im familiar with it, i found ways to calm myself but i still get so anxious in all my classes and it actually sucks because it’s hard to focus and actually pay attention because all im thinking about is my anxiety and trying to prevent it. 

there are still times where i feel like running out of class because of how anxious i am.

anxiety,1idfxim,Got through a panic attack,"Today I had a panic attack due to stress and unability to cope with the panic itself. Here's what happened.

My breathing started to get heavier. My hands and feet began to sweat profusely. I started feeling lightheaded and whoozy. I had racing thoughts of the fear of going crazy.

Then I sat in it and started to focus on my feet on the ground, the smell of the air, the texture of my desk, and the lighting of the room. This began the process of grounding. During this moment I was still super panicky and stressed. Then a minute went by and then 2 and then 5 and then 10. After the 10 minute mark I noticed that my breathing was relaxing and I wasn't forcing every breath, just letting the breath happen at what I thought was a normal pace. And after that as my breathing was relaxing then my mind started to stop racing and I was repeating ""anxiety cant hurt me"" over and over again and made myself think about the good side of anxiety instead of the bad. And then because I was thinking this way, the initial trigger thought started to ease up and my symptoms lessened more until I started to feel normal. After the panic attack I reminded myself that ""Panic attacks dont last forever. They come and go"". And for some reason that thought has been giving me the motivation to move forward. The awareness that it was a span of 30 minutes from start to finish put it in perspective for me. That anxiety is a symptom not a way of life. And that it doesnt have to control every waking thought.

anxiety,1idnmk5,What can i actually do to fix these? Where do i even start?  Im tired of wasting time doing nothing. Need help,"I just want to do something about it, i just dont know what that ""thing is"" or ""what work"" im supposed to be doing. Which is probably why i fall back to conditioned behaviors because of not knowing what to do or say. I just want to get out of this deep hole, improve for the sake of improvement, and try to make myself and my life better, and i truly dont wanna do all the improvement just to be liked or loved, i want to do it for myself. I dont want to construct a persona thats based on others reactions or construct it to be loved or cared about. 

We all want to feel important and be cared about and feel wanted and loved, with my way its like i try to force it, force connections or friendships, i dont like being so dependent on this, or make it the purpose of my life or revolve my around getting others to like me, i dont want ""making friends or a gf or conversations or being liked my singular goal in my life. 

im in my 20s, i dont want to be like 50 and still struggling with these problems, I want to do something about it right now bc the present is the most important, all those distractions, negative thoughts, toxic shame are basically useless. But idk what i wanna do, and i for sure dont want to go back to the old life style or personality or mindset or behaviors or beliefs systems or conditioned behaviors or addictions. 

I feel like i been taught the wrong lessons, the illogical beliefs, wrong beliefs, and repetitive negative thoughts but i dont want to blame anyone but take responsibility to do something about it. The control is totally in my hands i just dont know what to do about it. 

I think every problem stems from this. 
Basing self worth/happiness/success on others reactions or actions, basically using them as a vehicle for self esteem or using them to fill a void, or boredom, its like i have no genuine interest in them. Even though i would like to meet people since each one is a unique world on their own, but its like my desire for approval validation attention and to prove myself is way more than being interested. 

And only ""give to get"" which is just selfish and transactional. 

People pleasing like being a chameleon to be liked or accepted, the only thing i have known my entire life is people pleasing and chasing others and being dependent on their approval validation attention like an approval junkie, so i have no idea what i want or who i am truly, i havent put in the work or effort to figure out who i am or who i want to be, so im like a puppet and my decisions are based on others approval validation attention reactions, all aimed towards ""being loved, liked, cared about, chased"" and if those dont happen i feel worthless, not good enough not funny enough not intelligent enough. All of this to protect my ego, anything less than perfection is a failure

And everything is like a cover, a coping mechanism to avoid disapproval, and its out of the goodness of my heart, its selish, i do it in order to be considered ""good enough lovable interesting important""

chasing approval validation attention just to feel like im ""good enough""

Seeing others as a ""goal"" to achieve so i feel good enough, or to boost my confidence or ego, or feel ""good enough"" or be liked cared about be seen as important, and in order to ""achieve"" i become a chameleon because i dont know who i am truly.

I see others reactions as a indicator of my worth, so that's why i sometimes try to control others reactions which puts pressure on me and others, and i get angry at myself for my ""effort, personality, not being good enough or interesting enough"" to make others care.

Giving with strings attached 

Angry at myself for not being able to make a friend or get a gf even though i know even if i had them it wouldnt fix the internel problems, I think they are just another form of procastination or avoidance. 

Seeing a couple or friends talking/having fun activities my insecurities and beliefs about ""not interesting, boring, uncool"" and i immediately think im not good enough to have those, a few years in college with no friends that are two sided, and never a girl showed any interest in me, I know they dont owe me anything, if i wasn't interested why would they be? But no one has ever shown any care or interest

Which is why i avoid being around people, its like i need constant validation attention approval, even though i dont approve of myself and some of my behaviors like people pleasing, or giving with strings attached, when being around people its like i get ptsd and flashbacks to the times i was ignored or rejected or abandoned so i either try hard to prove that im ""interesting, good enough, intelligent, funny, cool, lovable, worth caring about, important"" or i try hard to avoid it, its like a cycle of insanity, neither approachs help or work or help me create a healthy connection where both contribute. 

It also makes me jealous, angry for not being as social as them and that they both like each other and its two sided interest, and have chemistry and banter together and flirt together it also makes me greedy where i keep wanting more and more, even though deep down i know those wont fulfill me, or fix me or make me happy or make me ""good enough"", its basically attachment to the outcome of every situation or interaction. And that im desperate and needy for a speck of attention approval validation. 

And i think i deflect those insecurities and flaws into others so i feel better about myself

those external factors are just ways to avoid doing the work even though i dont know what that is or where to even start

All those addictions, procrastination, avoidance, is just to keep me in the comfort zone, i want to get into the unknown, the uncertainty i just dont know how.

Every conversation is one sided, i dont know what to talk about or what to say, i see every interaction as a test of my ""self worth, intelligence, personality"" i see everything external like that, its like i have attached my worth to everything external because its ""easier"" than to face my own actions or mistakes or decisions or feelings. 

Using conditioned behaviors because they are all I know or been taught even though they dont work, its like i use these condioned behaviors as coping mechanisms, without them i dont know what i want or who i am, its basically ""unknown"" 

And in any interaction or situation my fight & flight mode becomes activated, i either ""fight"" to prove my worth, or flight to avoid the pain of rejection abandonment loneliness, and many times its ""flight"" because i dont know what to do, and its a new territory, new situation, and the fear of failure is too much

Thinking im only good enough when ""others chase me or talk to me or i make them laugh or love me"" its like conditional love towards myself, and if i dont achieve those im ""not good enough"" 

its like i act like a servant towards others and give even though what i give isnt good enough or genuine because idk how to give to myself so how can i give to others?

And i give just to receive and when i dont receive i feel like i wasn't interesting or cool or funny or good enough. I take it personally, like i wasnt worth caring about or wasnt important enough. 

Its like i have little fuel and i give it to others and expect them to give their all to me. Quite selfish i know

I think i give because fear of loneliness, rejection abandonment, in my mind thats like ""death"" and i do it so i dont become alone forever, because being alone and no one caring means ""worthless"" in my mind. 

Its like i do everything or say everything to avoid disapproval and gain approval, and be loved and liked. 



And forever i have used addictions like porn, tv shows, texting on social medias to numb the pain and the feelings of loneliness but they just make it worse, because i hate not changing, i hate passiveness and feelings of powerlessness but i know i can change, i just dont know what am supposed to do about it all",1,2025-01-30 15:02:20,0,1.0,Pristine_Tell_2450

I have had health anxiety around my heart for awhile now but had finally stopped thinking / worry about it because my heart rate went back down as I worked at my anxiety and came to realise it was caused from making my own cycle of stress. 

But here I am panicking again because my heart rate is 100+ bpm.. I am pretty sure I have to flu right now and that’s caused this, I am using all my will to tell myself this is normal during sickness and nothing is wrong, but I also have costocondritis (pain/inflammation of the chest) that has decided to come back with this flu. So feelings of chest pain, with heart palpitations is sending me spiralling and the thought of something seriously bad happening won’t stop. 

I know increased heart rate is part of the body fighting the flu, I know costocondritis can be triggered from the flu, I’m struggling to know how to deal with this. My heart anxiety stopped because I was able to get my stress under control and fix the palpitations in the first place- but because this is caused by the flu it’s out of my control to stop…

I had a fever all day that went up to 38.5c (101f) but it finally broke, and the heart palpitations started AFTER that not during for some reason? But now I’m wondering if it was happening then too and I just didn’t realise cause the fever was more my focus.

anxiety,1idl0mk,Gastroscopy and anxiety,"Hi all, 
So im new here and Im diagnosed with adhd and GAD.. I’ve had therapy for 3 months very intensive therapy which helped a lot for my GAD. I managed to stop my antidepressants. But since 2 years I’ve been having problems with my stomach and my digestion. (I’ve been taking the meds for nearly 2,5 years) 
Now I’ve stopped I hoped it also stopped but it didn’t. It progressively became worse. I took bupropion (Wellbutrin) and venlaflaxine.
Right now I’m just sick of it.. I take 3 tablespoon ACV (apple cider vinegar) daily diluted with water. Because everyday I have been having acid reflux. I couldn’t eat anything. Taking PPI’s made things worse and made me burp a lot nasty acidic burps. My doctor finally let me do a gastroscopy which is next week, and I’m afraid as hell.. today I also been having pain in my stomach.. and I’m just afraid for what if it’s something bad.. 
I had my blood work done and my lipase was a tad higher than normal. I got an echo of my abdomen where everything looked normal. And with my lipase somewhat high they didn’t do anything.. I’m extremely tired everyday, lack the energy and I feel constant nausea.. 
and this could all possibly be anxiety but I just don’t know anymore at this moment. I’ve also been thinking of if I might have LOW acids in my stomach and that’s why I feel so terrible.. but overal I’m dead afraid of the gastroscopy not for the tube but for the spray which numbs your throat.. I already have a fear to choke… so any tips would be so nice 🙏🏼🙏🏼",1,2025-01-30 12:35:28,0,1.0,Merijns1994
anxiety,1idkwhh,Haven’t heard from my partner,"I haven’t heard from my boyfriend now in about 24 hours, this is really unlike him and he even called and asked me yesterday morning after his night shift to text him through the day as usual.

My usual calls to him last night both went to voicemail, it’s not too unusual for him to be extremely busy or exhausted from long hours (normally i’d still hear something from him tho) so as strange as it was I let it go and went to bed. 
Waking up to no response and my messages still unopened has really set me on edge. I’m starting to worry something happened to him, like an accident on the road. 

He lives back home (3hrs) and i’m away for college, I still haven’t met his family due to the distance and have no contacts to check in. He’s a grown man, with a busy life, I feel as if if I did reach out to anyone without very good reason it would be an invasion of his privacy. I also feel like i might just be being ridiculous, but I’m making myself sick with worry.

-eating out in general or with other people i don’t really know well ESPECIALLY on vacation or if im a guest/its paid for. i get so nervous and anxious i can’t eat the food, one time i had to have my dad take me outside while i had a crying panic attack in boston during dinner once our food came out.

-being stuck on a plane once the doors close or like getting so nervous right before hand. i have a fight next month and ugh so nervous for when they close the doors if ill have a panic attack and can’t escape.

-not being able to sleep in my bed because im away somewhere and right before i leave say goodbye to everything ive ever known just incase when i travel somewhere its like the end and i get really really sad.

-NOT BEING ABLE TO SWALLOW MY FOOD without internally freaking out. i just cannot sometimes. if someone chokes on their food or throws up like it’s an AUTOMATIC no. 

-anxiety in classrooms. especially when i was in my senior year (maybe senioritis), i like genuinely felt so anxious all day everyday in my classes bc i couldn’t leave school everyday, college has been A LOt better for me but sometimes im sitting there and my heart is racing.

I’m a 26F previously been diagnosed with GAD and Panic Disorder back when I was 15. 

I’ve been in therapy since I was 15 and have worked tirelessly over the years to manage and successfully cope with my anxiety. 

I’ve had long bouts of debilitating anxiety throughout my life that has thrown me back down to 0 and relearn my way up again. 

I’ve suffered with on/off palpitations all my life never been concerned about them and all cardiologist tests have come back normal. 

Anyways, recently over the weekend while working out I may have over exerted myself that I felt a big palpitation in my chest, this led to 10 hours of sinus tachycardia, went to the hospital, got bloods, X-ray and ecg done all normal. 

I’m due for an echo and holster next week and cardiologist visit in March ages away. 

I’ve been placed on Atenolol in the mean time to lower my heart rate. 

I had another spike up to 140s mid week and I called the ambulance again, everything normal as usual. The Dr on call advised that he 100% thinks it’s anxiety related. 

Since being a on the beta blocker I still find myself getting anxious, having a high heart rate and today I went for a walk and was left feeling a mess. 

My chest was burning, my heart rate didn’t want to settle down, I wasn’t checking the rate I could just feel it. It felt really uncomfortable. The walk went well, my chest just felt a bit funny on. 

I don’t know if I’ve hyper fixated myself into such a anxious state but I’m lost on what to do. 

I’m seeing my psych tomorrow and I’m trying to convince myself I’m okay but this feels so terrible. 

Will it get better on the meds or is something wrong?

-Three forks and a singular cup

And to just throw only two clothing items in the washer. These tiny tasks would quite literally take less than 5 minutes combined to do, and I realize this, yet I still feel a tight feeling of anxiousness in my chest and stomach and I am irrationally afraid of getting up to start the task.

I have been sitting here for hours depriving myself of sleep due to the want of completing the task but the strong guilt and shame of it seeming impossible to do so. I have to wake up in a few hours but I will not sleep until I get it done. But I can't get it done. I feel as if I failed already. I don't know what's wrong with me. The fear of the potential negative consequences of not completing the task paralyzes me and beats me down, and it's contradictory. People who know about this issue I have ask, ""well, why not get it done so you don't see those negative consequences?"" I don't understand why myself, to be honest. I wish I knew.

How can I get myself to complete tasks when they seem so scary? Are there any tricks people use to help bring themselves to begin tasks/make them seem less scary? Or is it just me who feels this way",1,2025-01-30 08:44:53,2,1.0,leggsos

anxiety,1idaars,Anxiety and stress causing chest pain?,"I have been experiencing mild chest pain recently. I went to the hospital and got an ECG and a chest Xray which showed nothing out of the ordinary. I am starting to think it might be attributed to ongoing anxiety and stress I’ve been experiencing the last few months. The stress is due to unresolved problems in my life that I have been ignoring. 

Would it be possible that my body is telling me these unresolved issues are reaching boiling point? Yesterday I was an emotional wreck - felt like I was going to cry and then eventually I did for a few hours. It felt great to let me out and I now feel slightly better today.

Anyone else experienced anxiety to the point of it causing extreme health issues?

Since the new year I've felt like i haven't been as productive as i was previously and i was hitting a dead end. basically had to try something new. in my last therapy session, i constructed a plan, outline, steps (small steps, not overachieving or anything) to make progress during the week. it feels like within 2 days everything awful has unraveled and i don't have the tools to deal with it anymore. i was having stomach issues, whether it's a virus or anxiety induced...who knows? currently in the process of grieving a family family who just passed (on my birthday, incredible gift ha) and various other stresses from family and education responsibilities. i had some time off from last week and thought i was going to come back full swinging, but life has bashed me over the head with a golf club. i was on-and-off nauseous for two days straight. i guess with everything going on, my anxiety and fight or flight has been completely fried. my resting heart rate has been landing around 90-110 and walking is a whole other beast of discomfort. i take a beta blocker and i have had episodes like this from anxiety and stress, so the BB has helped immensely but the symptoms are still very noticeable despite not being as severe as they once were

i had a huge panic attack this morning triggered by a string of nightmares. my hands were clammy and i couldn't focus and it felt like my heart beating against my chest. only the beta blocker and washing my face with cold water helped. i always have worse anxiety in the morning but it's been so long since i've had ""a big one"". now i'm very hesitant to sleep. some things never change.

anxiety,1idc89j,I replaced my 3AM anxiety questions with these 10 Stoic ones - Here's how it transformed my mental clarity,"Hey everyone,

For years, I was the king of 3AM anxiety spirals. You know the ones - lying awake asking yourself ""why does this always happen to me?"" and watching your thoughts spin out of control.

A few months ago, I stumbled across Tim Ferriss's post about 17 life-changing questions, and it got me thinking about how the questions we ask ourselves shape everything. Going down that rabbit hole, I discovered that ancient Stoics were masters at asking better questions. So I decided to do an experiment: I'd replace my anxiety-inducing questions with Stoic-inspired ones for 30 days.

Here's what worked best:

For Anxiety & Overwhelm:

* Instead of ""Why does this always happen to me?"" → ""What's the opportunity here that I'm not seeing yet?"" (Marcus Aurelius used this one constantly - it's a game-changer for shifting perspective)
* Instead of ""What if everything goes wrong?"" → ""Will this matter in a year? A month? A week?"" (This kills thought spiraling instantly)
* Instead of ""How can I control everything?"" → ""What is actually within my control right now?""

For Difficult People:

* Instead of ""Why are they like this?"" → ""What virtue can I practice in this situation?"" (Turns annoying people into growth opportunities)
* Instead of ""How can I change them?"" → ""What if they're actually doing the best they can with what they know?""

For Decision-Making:

* Instead of ""What if I make the wrong choice?"" → ""What's the worst that could actually happen - and could I handle it?""
* Instead of ""What will others think?"" → ""What would I do if reputation didn't matter?"" (This one's uncomfortable but powerful)

The Daily Game-Changers:

* ""How can I make today a masterpiece within my control?"" (Morning question)
* ""What would this look like if it were easy?"" (For when you're overcomplicating)
* ""What would the wisest person I know do here?""

Results after 30 days:

* Sleep improved dramatically (no more 3AM spirals)
* Decisions felt clearer and easier to make
* Improved relationships (stopped trying to fix everyone)
* More focused on what I can actually control
* Less overthinking, more action

The biggest surprise: The questions themselves matter more than the answers. Better questions automatically lead to better thinking patterns.

Marcus Aurelius was right: ""The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."" Turns out, the quality of your thoughts depends on the quality of your questions.

Would love to hear what questions have help others stay grounded.",2,2025-01-30 03:44:26,0,1.0,Jonhigh15
anxiety,1idglv5,Is it thanx to meds or forced exposure?,"I have always had anxiety and the ups and downs were manageable. I had a major change in my life these last 6 months as I moved with my husband to another country and leaving my family especially parents was tough. I have been jobless for 4 years because of my anxiety and lack of confidence and imposter syndrome and my last job experience ended with a burnout and depression. 
In the new country I had to apply for a job in order to pay the bills and just going through the interview process was taking a toll on me. I managed with the help of anxiety meds and SSri (low doses). When I finally got a job, instead of feeling happy I started to feel more and more anxious until I had my first full blown panic attack. Then I was having another one every day that would last the whole day. One of the attacks was so big I ended up at the ER where I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Ativan 0.5 mg as needed and upped my dose of Lexapro (escitalopram) from 10 to 15mg to 20mg. The simple thought about the new job was flaring my anxiety and triggering panic attacks. I wished I could just run away and turn them down but it was not an option as my husband didn't have a job and we had to pay rent. 
So I had to start the new job (remote from home in customer service) and I would wake up with crazy anxiety and strong nausea and throwing up. I was mortified to have to speak to clients after my training and I was afraid to fail and not be up to the task. As the training went by, I was realizing that it was not that bad and I was lucky to have a supporting boss and team. My panic attacks started diminishing in occurrence and intensity. I started doing the calls and to my surprise it went good. After my 3rd day on the phone I was even congratulated by my boss for my great statistics. The panic attacks stopped and the anxiety became more manageable. I started to feel better and is trying to figure out whether is thanks to my forced exposure to the job situation or is it thanks to the upped dose of medication or both? I'm scared and worried to lose this again. ",0,2025-01-30 07:26:15,0,0.5,Kaheena_
anxiety,1idbzc8,Should I start medication or is it the drugs talking?,"Hello lovely people,

I'm looking for advice on my current situation. I've struggled with anxiety for a long time, pretty much for as long as I can remember, and I'm debating on starting a medication to help with it.

Sometimes I feel entirely convinced that it's what I need, or just that I need something more than what I'm doing now (CBT and talk therapy). My problem is that I mostly feel this way while high. I only smoke weed 1-2 times a month, but when I do I usually end up feeling this way: way more in tune with myself and totally convinced that I need something more.

I feel at times radically different, like there's this whole other capable me on the other side of these anxious feelings and that I just need something to rip me out of this anxious-depressive cloud I'm in. I'm just not sure if these moments are real or drug-fueled. That being said, when I do smoke it's only in small amounts, like lightweight small amounts lol so the amount of inhibited I am is nowhere close to stoned.

I feel like I just need to trust myself, truly. And in writing this I feel like I'm just convincing myself more to try it out, but I guess I'm just looking for advice. I know weed can alleviate anxiety but I'm not sure how/if it compares to actual meds.

Reframe your thoughts - I do this and the thoughts come back worse than before. 
Try deep breathing - temporary relief. 
Mindfulness - temporary relief. 
Take SSRIs - it helps but causes other issues. 
Anxiety is just trying to protect you - well it certainly does not feel like it and if I know this why doesn't it stop? 
There are people with serious illnesses and you're worrying about stuff that doesn't matter - yeah I am aware of this but it doesn't stop the anxiety and believe me, I don't want to feel this way.
Don't take SSRIs, they just mask what's going on deep down - so you expect me to live without them and barely function?

Why is my own brain doing this to me? Why can't I just be normal? What did I do to deserve this crap? I feel really sorry for myself and anyone else who deals with shitty anxiety. 
I'm not even as bad as I have been previously but the fear of it getting that bad again stops me from enjoying my life

Don't fear anxiety! That makes the cycle worse! - Well how do you stop fearing it? How can you not fear something that makes you feel trapped in your own body, terrified and unable to live normally?

anxiety,1idancx,How concern should I be?,"Please bare with me as I try to highlight important points about my current events. 


So , I would say that I began experiencing anxiety about 4 months ago. At first I was not completely aware. That’s because I had no experiences similar before in the past (or at least that I remember). Basically I would describe them as panic/anxiety attacks, the first three instances was while I was high on THC. I been a heavy smoker of THC but more specifically oil vapes , but never had to deal with this before. I would say I began smoking at the age of 19, but at first it was primarily flower during the weekends then gradually began smoking regularly around age of 21 and then strictly began smoking oil THC because I did not want to sink / smell / avoid getting in trouble . I’m 28 now but would say that I abused THC since covid days. But , there was various of times I went cold turkey which actually wasn’t THAT difficult. Ok , back to recent days. Two episodes was in my house watching television and the other was in public at a comedy show. Each happened about few weeks intervals. I was able to contain all three of them , but didn’t know exactly what was going on. On my latest episode (4th one) which was Jan 24, I was in public (sober) and then felt like I was having a heart attack. Then called 911 for help and went to the ER . I was explaining to them that a week ago I had flu/covid like symptoms and thought that the Illness was lingering causing damage to my organs, because my endurance, lungs , and heart felt discomfort ever since the sickness. They cleared me and told me that everything was normal / healthy , but that I most likely have anxiety. That’s when I puzzled it together, but almost couldn’t believe it. They prescribed me ibuprofen (600mg) and hydroxyzine (25mg). Ever since I’ve been out of the ER I feel like it just crippled me, and wish they would have just told me that I was healthy instead of saying “yea you got anxiety here’s some pills”. I have this (tension) headache that’s been bothering me ever since the ER room , which sprouts from negative thoughts/fears. Here’s the bizarre thing, I don’t know exactly why I began to feel this way. I have a job that doesn’t over stress me , no debt , no strain relationships. I’m pretty stable currently basically. I been sober since early January, and even began a work out routine , was feeling pretty well until I got hit with that sickness. And awaken my anxiety . I would say that I’ve had extremely more difficult times in the past, but always felt that I’ve overcame them completely. I possibly was unconsciously smoking to help me get through the difficult moments, but to me I was just enjoying smoking. I have a ton of support behind me (friends and family) that I’ve already disclosed this situation too. Since the ER I took ibuprofen twice to decrease my headache discomfort which would help but will return the following day. I also just took 1 dose of hydroxyzine for the first   time as I’m writing this just to test things out. So far I’m getting common side effects, but it’s helping calming mind. I would even say it’s pretty close to getting high on weed. I already have my first appointment with a CP/PCP on February 10th and will explain to him my situation.

anxiety,1id4xg8,Does your anxiety ever make you do risky impulsive things?,"It's so odd that I'm such a cautious person but at times when my anxiety is so high it's overwhelming I've found myself doing really risky things, like binge eating despite it serious aggravating health issues, getting into a stupid and nasty argument with the owner at a local place I always visit (which essentially made me not be able to go there to shop anymore and make my shopping way more difficult now that I don't have transportation), things like that? I always regret it but in the moment feel so ignored, so miserable, so alone in my pain at that time which probably explains why my brain doesn't work then. I'm acting on impulse. It's like you got a venous skin on your back. You can't think straight and escaping the imaginary snake you fall into a real well.

anxiety,1id2933,Does anybody else play horror games or watch horror movies to release anxiety?,"I recently started playing Amnesia: The Bunker (fantastic game btw) and of course I get anxious trying to be quiet & not make too much noise in the dark (the monster in the game is attracted to noise, but hates the light) Plus there’s mutated rats that will attack you too. 

Yet, whenever the monster comes out of its hiding & starts chasing me and kills me, my anxiety is gone. As much as I hate getting killed and starting over again, it’s really nice and refreshing to be free of my anxiety (even if it’s just temporary) 

The same thing happens when I watch horror movies. The build up and suspense leading up to a kill builds my anxiety, but once the kill or jump scare happens & it’s over, my anxiety disappears. It feels so good. Horror is such a fantastic release.

I tried Propranolol and it literally did nothing. 
I also am currently taking Valdoxen (been a few months) and also literally nothing. 

Are SSRIs my next step such as Sertraline etc? I have a prescription for a few of these (my GP wrote them out and said to do my research) but I'm not sure if they are a pretty brutal fix for ehat I believe is really just a single symptom.

anxiety,1idc2hc,Turning a good thing into a bad one,"So, yesterday I was in one of my classes in which I have only one acquaintance. I try to participate at least once or twice per class, since it's a discussion/seminar type of class. Some students participate a bunch of times every single class. There's one particular student who looks like the confident type, expresses himself very well, makes fun of his own ignorance and mistakes, asks questions without worrying if people will think he's stupid.. you know the type: the one that tends to attract people. He comes across as a very laid back yet clever lad, very self-confident and in peace - basically all I'd like to be. Although I'm not as awkward as I was before (due to treatment) I am still too self-conscious.

Anyway, I never even considered that this guy and I could ever interact. We're around 30 students in a packed classroom, and we never ever sat remotely close to each other. When I speak, I always look at the prof, and this other lad does the same, so I think none of us is aware of who else might be looking at us as we speak. In any case, after class ended, I left with my acquaintance, we said our goodbyes, and I headed to the library. When I found a spot and was getting ready to start working - there comes the confident guy from class. I thought he'd just ignore me, as so many do, so I continued getting my stuff out of my backpack. Then I noticed the guy was actually coming towards me. I raised my eyes and yep, there he was. He asked me what I thought of the class, what my major is, introduced himself formally, we had a quick chat and he left.

I know this is probably nothing. Maybe the lad just saw me and thought it would be stupid not to acknowledge my existence since we are in the same class. Maybe he was just being polite when he came to me and made some small talk. In any case, I should see this as a *positive* thing: one of the most, let's say, popular students in the classroom decides to say hi to me even though he already has friends and acquaintances there. But here I am, trying to figure out what is *behind* it. Was he pitying me? Was he somehow mocking me? Was he being nice so he can't be seen as a 'bad' person, even if it means talking to me, a student who participates but is far from being interesting in any way? Maybe tomorrow or next week he'll start pretending I don't exist?

One of the things I hate about my anxiety disorder is how it manages to make me doubt any single possibly good thing into something that simply *can't* be good. I'm so used to being cast aside or to people being indifferent to me that when something like this happens, instead of just feeling good about it, I start asking myself, 'where's the catch?'

Anyone else feel like this? How do you cope?",1,2025-01-30 03:36:51,0,1.0,RodrikDaReader
anxiety,1idc0kd,I’m alone.,"So I’m pretty sure my anxiety started July 2024 right after finishing a music video. I was at an in n out restaurant with the team and suddenly my world started caving in. I called 911 as I was hyperventilating right by the drive thru line and as they calmed me down I reached out to my family to pick up my car as I was too shaky to get behind the wheel. Luckily I live next to a Kaiser so I went and they said I had vertigo. Left with some pills and recovered, so I thought. As weeks went by i started developing symptoms such as chest tightness, tension, headaches and loneliness. It got so bad I went back to the ER shaking and immediately they hooked me up to an ekg, ran blood and by the grace of God everything cleared. That peace of mind lasted around 6 days so, I made a trip to a long time friend/doctor in Baja California and he to ran tests and everything came back with good news. The symptoms subsided as the holidays wrapped up and was good just in time for the new year. Other than me losing my day job (store closed down) and regular every day stressors I was doing fine, until last night. I was on my way to play soccer and I felt the chest tightness once again and decided to go home. My house is usually empty but luckily my sister was home so I just started yapping while researching the usual “am I having a heart attack?” I haven’t been sleeping good as I often wake up with tension on my right side behind the neck and upper traps, I’m going through a massive creative block and I have 0 people to confidently talk to. The only time I open up is when I’m describing my symptoms to a doctor. I feel lost, unheard, and alone.

anxiety,1idb9b6,a person's mom was rude to me when i called about me helping her daughter with confidence issues and now im stuck on what to do,"im so scared

for starters im a 16 year old female. i thought i was doing a good thing by attempting to help a little girl (about 11) with her confidence, but because she's a child, i had to go through her mom first. so i made that dreaded phone call and spoke in my native tongue to her mother but her mom shut down my help and said who are you to judge my daughter and accuse her of needing help, you dont live with her and im her mom. 

however, i received a note from that poor girl saying how happy she was for me to help her and she'd be really happy if i could help her but her mom shut down the idea so fast (i gave her a gift and a note saying how i want to help her and how ive noticed that she's scared and how i want to make her feel a little better)

i accidently said if we could meet up this saturday but now i really want to back out

im way to scared and i dont know how to approach this case

i really want to help the girl at the same time, her mom is a roadblock and im way to anxious to speak to her on saturday

i already said that it was okay and that it wasn't that big of a deal but i cant stop shaking she's gonna be so mad at me why have i complicated her life even more i should just back off but i cant she needs my help i feel so stuck what do i do if her mom screams at me?

now im pretty sure that her mom is talking shit about me to her family and now idk what to do she never comes to the weekend class im in and instead her older brother picks her up so i know this is a hassle for her and she sounded so mad over the phone call so i dont want to do anything with her mom anymore idk what to do i keep on shaking 

this was such a bad idea and now they are all gonna be mad at me and ive failed to help idk what to do?

my aunt (the teacher of that weekend class), doesnt have the time for us to talk and i thought that i could find a way to arrange a time with her mom but she's so mean and i guess i should just back off

im just so stuck should i just say the truth about her note or should i just say ""oh it's alright sorry to waste your time"" and talk to the girl during class or something?",1,2025-01-30 02:59:15,0,1.0,Worth_Goal9423

anxiety,1idax3c,"experiencing health anxiety for the first time in my life, afraid of going to the doctor","Hey guys, just posting in the hopes of getting this off my (23F) chest...

The funny thing is, I've always been a worry wart and the type of person to stress over the worst possible outcome, even with the most inconsequential shit, but never in my life have I worried over my health. If anything, I was quicker than most to dismiss health concerns and remained fairly calm throughout the lockdown-era of the pandemic. 

I won't get into it, but starting early last year, I began experiencing some new symptoms. Went on for a while, a few months or so, barely even a blip on my radar. One day, without much thought, just out of idle curiosity, I googled my symptoms. Big fucking mistake. I used to laugh along with everyone else at the jokes about doctor google diagnosing even the most benign things as cancer. I wish I could laugh now. I didn't take the things I was reading seriously at first and brushed them off as usual, but for whatever reason, I slowly became obsessed with the idea that something was seriously wrong with me. I was googling the same thing over and over again. I was on medical subreddits constantly (the absolute WORST). Bothering family and friends with constant questions, the same questions, over and over and over, and never believing a word of what they said when they tried to reassure me. To make matters worse, my symptoms seemed to intensify and multiply. Headaches became a regular occurrence. Neck pain. Trouble sleeping. 

For months, I was, I realise now in retrospect, incredibly depressed. I was still able to get up out of bed and go to work and dowhatever else the day demanded of me, but I was plagued by a constant sense of dread, impending doom, like my life was already over. 

It has gotten better, though I'm not out of the woods yet. 

I went to the doctor fairly early on to see if I could get to the bottom of things and was told it was nothing to worry about. To be clear, I did not feel as though the doctor was being dismissive  or anything like that. I'm sure if I went back and expressed the full extent of my concern they would have taken me seriously. I just couldn't bring myself to. I convinced myself that if there was a problem, they would never find it. 

I began to fear catching a cold. Whenever I cut my hand at work, I would worry about sepsis. I stopped wanting to share food with people. I would flinch if someone coughed near me. I would try to avoid hugs. 

I hate this. Never before in my life have I gone through something as terrifying as this. It feels like a complete loss of control. Mindfulness doesn't help. CBT methods don't help. The only thing that seems to have any kind of effect is literally just ignoring it all, grinning and bearing it. 

The thing is, I do actually want to go back to the doctor, but I'm hesitating because the anxiety ridden part of my brain is telling that my previous avoidance, stemming from fears that they would find something wrong with me, will now, ironically, have lead to me ignoring a serious complication to the point of it being too late for anything to be done about it. 

Sorry if this is a bit of an incoherent ramble. I am honestly just so baffled by what I've been through over the past ten months or so. It has been hell on earth at times. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I guess the bright side is that it has been an incredibly humbling, humiliating ordeal. I have been faced with the fact of my own overwhelming cowardice and aversion to fear, which, of course, is an incredibly debilitating form of fear in itself. 

Still haven't made that doctor's appointment. Two week waiting list where I am to even see a GP and I'm starting a new job very soon so of course I'm using that as an excuse—don't want to miss any work so early on! Ha. 

All this to say, if anyone else is going through the same, my heart goes out to you. I am incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by people who are willing to put up with my bullshit and I still feel completely isolated. I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be to deal with something like this alone. 

At one of my lowest points, I wrote in my diary, ""I hope I can laugh at this one day"" and I really do, I hope we all can

For the past five months, I have experienced random panic attacks. My heart rate will spike up to about 170bpm out of the blue even if I’m not feeling anxious. When my heart rate spikes up, that’s what causes my anxious feelings. My chest and throat feel tight, I feel like I’m dying, and my heart races. I’ve done several ekgs, blood work, ultra sounds, x rays, tilt table test, wore 2 rounds of a 14 day heart monitor and doctor’s say it’s just anxiety/panic attacks. Sometimes I feel like my heart drops and then my heart starts racing. 
For instance, just today I was at Costco and I felt like my heart dropped like 2 times and my heart rate spiked to 160. I left my cart and went to my car and tried to calm down. I was able to get my heart rate down to about 100bpm. It’s so scary. It’s so scary.

anxiety,1ida44f,Weird feeling,"

I know this subreddit isn’t used to give out diagnoses but I was hoping I could get a general idea about what’s wrong with me, and if anyone can help me figure out what I should do.

So right now I feel nervous all the time and whenever I think of doing anything I feel a weird nervous feeling in my chest. This can be caused from literally anything that requires me to take an action; getting out of bed, putting something on to watch, going to shower, going to make food etc. I don’t feel it when talking to people unless they’re new and I usually don’t feel it when I’m out with others. I always feel stopped whenever I try to do anything and it feels like I sometimes just can’t do it. I’ve tried to force myself to do things and not run away from the feeling but it has never improved, and it feels terrible trying to do anything.

Idk if this’ll help but I’ll give some context. 
I think this was triggered by events of last year when I used to put a lot of pressure on myself to do well in uni, while also trying to juggle a relationship and friends. I started getting constant headaches that never went away. From the moment I woke up to the moment I slept. Then one day during an argument with my ex, i felt a deep sharp pain through my heart. It hurt to breathe and I  felt a pain running down my neck. This would happen every so often for about two week. One time it was so bad that I felt like I couldn’t stand at all without feeling like I would collapse. Eventually it went away and the doctors said it was likely heartburn. Then towards the end of the year, I felt manic. I felt pressured by everything from uni to my relationship, I still had the headaches, and I felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t do or focus on anything at all. I was convinced I needed to break off my relationship just to feel normal. The manic sort of behaviour stopped but everything else is still happening to a lesser degree. The main thing that’s affecting me now is that nervous feeling and inability to focus.

Does this sound like anxiety or is this somewhat normal?",1,2025-01-30 02:04:58,0,0.99,slaywrldsol
anxiety,1icsq0h,Going to the dentist for the first time in years and petrified.,"Hey, so Im in my 20s now and I havent been to the dentist since I was like 9? I always avoided going, I freeze at the very idea. I havent been great about my teeth care either, i really struggled with doing it and have only recently started brushing my teeth regularly. However, my partner and I were going over our budget, and he said kinda off-handed that I should go to the dentist, and so I booked an appointment, and now im just terrified. Like my dentist when I was a kid was kinda mean? But I was also a kid, so maybe im just exaggerating the whole thing? What if everythings wrong with my teeth because I haven't been in so long? Dentistry isn't covered by insurance, so i everythings wrong with my teeth then its even worse. Apps in a month, 

Can someone whos been the dentist recently, just like, outline what usually happens in a regular checkup? What do they do? What do they do if somethings wrong with my teeth? I legit don't remember at all how the dentist works. ",10,2025-01-29 13:32:38,7,1.0,Rich-Replacement-901

anxiety,1id4jh5,How can I stop being so hyper aware?,"To keep it short and sweet: I’ve had several issues in the past like migraines, panic attacks and vertigo that have absolutely traumatized me. So much so, that I am so overly vigilant about their symptoms, like temporary eye floaters, tingling/numbness, dizziness and nausea. For example, I can sometimes feel a slightly off balanced feeling and when that happens I go from 0 to 60 with worry and the off balanced feeling intensifies into a stronger dizziness. Once this happens it’s nearly impossible to stop obsessing over it or distracting myself from it. I know that people say ignoring it and continuing to live your life is the solution, but trying to ignore it can sometimes make the symptoms or feelings more powerful or make them last longer. I could be having a great day when a bright light shines in my eye, leaving me momentarily blind and I’m thoroughly convinced it’s the beginning of a migraine. Idk. I’m a normal person who just wants their life back, but I feel like EVERY DAY I am plagued by this hyper awareness of sensations that keep me feeling afraid and unwell. Can anyone help?

anxiety,1id4d7m,RE: commiseration on distrust,"So, mental illness runs in my family. Sister has a schizo-affective disorder that has ravaged her life and traumatized my family. Her current whereabouts are unknown and that is a source of immense grief for us. My mother is an anxious person, who has had bouts of recurring depression. She, to my knowledge, has never received formal treatment in the way of therapy and/or prescribed medication. I have been dealing with “anxiety and depression” (diagnosed “generalized anxiety disorder”) since my early teens (early 30s now). 

I have received treatment on and off (therapy and prescribed medication) since my teen years. 

Today, I have what one might call a profound distrust of authority. Subsequently, I do not trust that the medical professionals who are sworn to act in my best interest as their patient will in fact do so. 

This isn’t all their fault, I realize. I’m an American, I live in America. I am working-class, at the low-end of the income spectrum. No universal healthcare, can’t afford, or qualify for great insurance. The CEO of my healthcare company was recently assassinated to much acclaim — so that might tell you about the quality of my coverage. So, yes, the treatment that is available to me isn’t exactly world-class to begin with.

That said…

I find the methodologies of available and accessible practitioners to be tired and lazy. They seem not to think critically before diagnosing and then prescribing “appropriate” medication. It seems - on the surface - a dubious practice of trial and error. 

Like, “You seem sad a lot — take this happy pill!”

When I protest, and suggest that maybe I’m sad because I find myself in state of disorganized thinking, unable to focus/prioritize, and unable to sleep — I’m told that there’s a “procedure”. We have to “rule out” depression before we can justify administering a test for ADHD, etc. 

I don’t like feeling like a guinea pig. Over-medicated. I hear horror stories about mis-medication; having your mind neutered and your life thrown further into disarray. And they scare me and foment/sow even more distrust — which, I actually do want to assuage so I can help my “medical team” help me towards stability and self-actualization, yatta-yatta. 

Can anyone relate? Similar journeys? Take the pills and manage my expectations? Eager to read any thoughts on the subject.

anxiety,1id9ecs,Losing it because I'm worried the fire alarm is going to go off,"Posting this here because I don't have anyone to talk to about this in real life.

I (18) am in my first year of college, living in a dorm, and the fear that the fire alarm in my residence hall (or whichever other building I'm in) may go off consumes my thoughts. I have had a fear of fire alarm systems - specifically the red horn-strobe type that makes loud, shrill beeping sounds - for as long as I can remember, but the issue subsided somewhat in recent years because my high school was in a newer building that had a newer and quieter fire alarm system. 

Now, however, I've just returned from winter break to my dorm and many other buildings at my university which use the shrill and loud systems that I'm afraid of, and this fear is hindering my ability to function normally and causing me a significant amount of stress. I have a hard time concentrating on anything while in any of these buildings because of the persistent stress that the alarm may go off. I only go to my dorm to shower and sleep, which I dread, and I minimize time in the lobby and hallway where the horn strobes are. When in classes, I can only focus on the actual material like half the time because I spend the rest of the time worrying about whether someone might set off the alarm. I try to be outside whenever possible, and if I have to be inside, I stay mostly in new buildings that are more likely to be equipped with voice evacuation systems.

I've also noticed that although this fear has been a part of my life forever, it tends to become more active when I'm also stressed about other things; with various other stresses increasing recently, this one has also become worse. I'm not really sure what to do about this; I've considered going to the university's counseling, but I am unsure that they can do anything to help with this (and also I'm embarrassed by it). Has anyone found a solution to this kind of issue that has worked, or do I just have to put up with this and try to continue living my life as much as possible?

  
TL;DR: The constant fear that my dorm or class fire alarm is going to go off is inhibiting my ability to learn and function normally. What do I do?",1,2025-01-30 01:34:12,0,1.0,Repulsive_Cat_9323

My mom decided to cook salmon last night and ended up using some sort of dry citrus rub that had onions, cayenne, spices and MSG in it. I ate the fish and within 3 hours, I was feeling hot, dizzy and ridiculously anxious. I couldn't sit still. I also was experiencing brain fog. 
I realized what it was. JUST now (the next day), my anxiety levels have waned.

Certain foods ABSOLUTELY trigger my anxiety and exacerbate something that would otherwise been completely manageable.
I'm talking processed carbs, high fructose corn syrup, chocolate, MSG, onions, garlic, apple cigar vinegar, anything fermented etc.

anxiety,1icxv9s,How do I help my girlfriend with her anxiety?,"My (20M) girlfriend (21F) has an anxiety disorder. She has severe anxiety daily and multiple panic attacks a week. It impedes everyday life with things like:  
  
\- Having to ask me if I'm mad at her because I'm in a low mood  
\- Getting overwhelmed over piled up dishes, and internally freaking out and having to sit on the floor  
\- Having a full blown panic attack because I want to have sex and she's not in the mood. Guilt evolves into anxiety and then anxiety around the anxiety.  Eventually she starts to fidget and dissociate and can't look at me or speak at all.  
  
A lot of it, I think, stems from low self esteem and feelings of being a bad partner.  
  
I'm usually her caregiver. She has a therapist, but they have low availability. I remind her when she needs a weed gummy, I calm her down from panic attacks. I help her do things that are difficult or frustrating. Honestly, I'm really burnt out and starting to build resentment.  
  
I want her to go on meds. She's been on meds before, and they worked well, but she doesn't want to be dependent on drugs. I've also pushed for a new therapist but she's scared of that. My opinion is that living like this is not acceptable or sustainable for either of us and something needs to change.   
  
It's been hard to be intimate and spend quality time together. I want my partner back!  
  
I write here on r/anxiety because I'd like to hear perspectives from people who have experienced this sort of thing. What would you do? Am I being hard on her? Is it wrong of me to push for meds? How long will this go on 😭

anxiety,1id8ecm,Derealisation after alcohol,"Hi everyone, i wanted to start this by saying that english is not my first language so if i make a mistake im sorry :). 

i've always been an anxious person, i had ocd when i was a child and i sometimes have ocd flare ups but they pass. Ive always had motivation for life and for my dreams to come true. In 2022 i had a really bad breakup as a result of a breakup i started smoking cigarettes which i never did before and i messed up my sleep schedule. I used to drink alcohol but nothing major would happen i would have the normal hangover symptoms. With anxiety i know that a person has more chance to think of something bad than good so i was really negative when thinking. In 2024 i wanted to drastically change my life and be more healthy. In february of 2024 i started drinking alcohol but not like everyday,in may of 2024 i went out with my friends and we had too much to drink i even passed out and made a really bad mistake (went back to my exs house) and felt really low about myself. After one week of this happening i had a really bad panick attack that gave me derealisation but i smoked one cigarette and the derealisation passed but i was feeling so down and sad out of nowhere about my life. This feeling started to pass i wasnt googling online and i was keeping myself busy even tho my sleep was messed up and i was still smoking. All summer i was anxious about a situation in my private life and to cope i would go out clubbing and drink with my friends(not everyday but every week i would have alcohol). I would drink to get tipsy and i never blacked out. In august of 2024 i went out with my friends again and we had way to much alcohol we even went to a club and a guy offered me a shot of tequila and after that shot i passed out(idk if my drink was spiked) i passed out and my whole body was paralysed. I was conscious and i was panicking because i thought i was dying i couldnt control my urine so i pissed myself. My friends took me home my sister helped me to shower and i went to sleep i was really sleepy. In the morning i couldnt remember what happened but later it all clicked. After 1 week of this happening i had my birthday and i was really sad bevause i broke up with someone and i was feeling really lonely and depressed i was trying to ignore my feelings when one day before bed i had a panick attack same as in May and i started oanicking and was scared to fall asleep. Later on i fell asleep somehow i dont even remember how and in the morning i was deep in derealisation, everything felt fake i had really bad thoughts about reality the thoughts were like this 

1. Nothing makes sense 
2.Why are we here 
3.Im never gonna be happy nothing will satisfy me 
4.Am i in a dream
5.Everything is fake 
6.nothing has meaning etc

I was thinking of my career my purpose and i would think to myself "" why do i have to work when everything is fake nothing matters this is hopeless"" and i was really scared of these thoughts,i started googling these questions and depression would come up my anxiety was really bad. My ear was ringing all the time my stomach was full with butterflies, i couldnt eat,i couldnt sleep, i didnt have motivation to do things, i felt hopeless and then i made an appointment with a psychologist. I told him everything and he told me that this is normal after a stressful time in our lives and that this is a sign that your body cant cope up with alcohol anymore. He told me this is not depression this is just anxiety and it will pass. After 5 months im feeling way better but i sometimes have intrusive thoughts that scare me and now im thinking that the derealisation flared up my ocd and im having existencial ocd. Has anyone ever experienced something like this. If yes i promise you everything will go back to normal but im just asking because when im on my period i sometimes get the same thoughts as before and they scare me but i know it will pass.

anxiety,1id6bt6,Any tips on overcoming anxiety while in a relationship?,"I'm \[F23\] starting to consider getting prescripted medication again from my psychiatrist, but I'd like some advice on how could I move forward and be a better girlfriend to my boyfriend \[M24\].

Lately my primary trigger around my bf is when he comes home late and doesn't update me. Since he only uses public transportation when he goes home from work, I'm well aware that the area he lives in is not really a safe place, especially past 11 pm. He's been rendering a lot of overtime at work and I'm happy that he's been really dedicated and all, I just get worried a lot whenever he forgets to update me.

Additionally, I go to sleep around 11 pm or 12 am and wake up at 4 am for work (I know, my body clock is a bit fucked up and I'm trying to work on it), and whenever I see that he hasn't texted me yet, I try to call him because the latest he can go in doing overtime at work is at least 4 am to 5 am (his usual shift is from 10 am to 7 pm).

For my part, I'm tired of letting my anxiety get the best of me in this situation, and I want to let it go since I don't have any control over his time, especially when he gets focused at work, but its difficult since its honestly my first time being in a healthy relationship with someone. So yeah, I'm here asking for advice because I really want to make this work, so any kind tips or suggestions would be really helpful. Thank you!",1,2025-01-29 23:17:33,0,1.0,North_Two8196
anxiety,1id676x,Teenage Daughter Social Anxiety-Yells at me a lot,"My 16yo has always experienced social anxiety. From the soccer field and dance classes sitting alone to high school not joining clubs and having a friend or 2. She has selective mutism when asked questions or talks really softly. She does try to put herself out there like getting a job but she is very quiet  until she feels comfortable. When she comfortable with people she is has word vomit and you can’t stop her. She is not medicated and I suspect ADD presenting as anxiety but refuses to get evaluated. In addition, she yells at me when she is anxious or upset. Tells me I don’t say the right things or my tone is mean. No matter what I do she says I am a bad mom. These verbal attacks have increased as she’s gotten older as there are more social situations. It is happening so much that I feel it’s abusive. And now every time it happens I end up crying when she leaves. Of course she comes back later in a good mood like nothing happened.

anxiety,1id537o,does anyone else have hyperventilation?,"Mine started back in 2024, and it's been chronic and constant ever since, but I know it's most likely chronic stress related, or something because heart and lung, and breathing problems don't run in my family. And I have no history of it. An Di have been trhough stressful things the past few years. (I was fine and healthy before the events happened, but my symptoms abruptly started after going through things. constant cyber-bullying etc..) So I think I know what's going on just from that alone.

And I'm 16. like my breathing just feels fast, through my chest. (I'm an stomach breather. ) And it feels like I'm not getting enough air, or that I can't breathe properly, and it's like fast short-ish breathing through my chest.

I know I'm not alone. and I know that many others also suffer/suffered with it. I think its chronic hyperventilation syndrome. my mum had it where it lasted for months for her. (I think she was stressed aat the time.) So I know I'm not alone but it's so scary.

I'm wondering what techniques I can try out? I been getting into EFT tapping which helps slow down my heart rate for a bit. But I wanna try ones for my breathing next. I been wanting to try out different techniques. Until I'm able to see a doctor. (I'm almost positive I have GAD or depression, chronic stress or something.)

Ive been perscribed zoloft / sertraline because of family history (it's worked for my sister's depression and anxiety but my brother had a bad experience with lexapro so SSRIs just scare me).

anxiety,1ichd8u,Life was good. Until the day I almost passed due to pneumonia.,"I'm 23, in perfect health. I have a newborn and a wonderful husband. Life was great, the happiest I have ever been. My husband got the flu, which I ended up catching shortly after. We were sick, went to the doctor and got medication. The week went on and after a few more days I couldn't breathe anymore. It was so bad I couldn't walk down the stairs, my mother in law had to help me slide down. She took me to the ER.

When I got to the ER my vitals were horrible, my blood pressure extremely low, oxygen at 70%, and my heart rate reached 200. While I was there my oxygen went lower and lower until I went hypoxic. I got intubated, put on a ventilator, and transferred to the ICU where I spent 6 days in a coma. When I woke up I spent another week in the hospital. In and out of hallucinating from all the meds, not being able to sleep or breathe without oxygen. Couldn't get out of bed even for the bathroom. I had delusions of the hospital staff and my husband trying to kill me. The doctor said I was going through psychosis episodes. I was trying to attack my husband and attempting to rip the tubes out. I vaguely remember this.

Eventually I finally fully came back to reality, I lost sense of time for a while. I learned from the doctor that if I didn't go to the hospital when I did, I wouldnt have made it through the night. Well my anxiety has been at an all time high since. I'm terrified of my pneumonia coming back, scared of all the hallucinations I had. My anxiety tricks me into feeling all my symptoms again, it's tricked me into thinking I'm having a stroke. It's been the devil. I've always had anxiety, but it has never been this horrible.

I'm so mad that this happened, my life was going perfectly, now I have nurses coming to my house almost everyday to check on me. I love life but now I'm living in fear everyday. My anxiety constantly brings me back to the ICU room.

anxiety,1icyu8y,"Does saying “I have anxiety, so excuse me if I’m a huge bitch. Don’t take it personally” cancel out the bitchy attitude?","I was diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder in 1993. I’ve been on all the medications and they work great even after all these years. I still have my moments, I mean more than one a day but I’ve never taken my anxiety issues out on others. 

Is this a different kind of anxiety disorder? Or was this just an excuse to be rude? 

I’ve been doing a lot of volunteer work lately and I ran into this one person who said “I have anxiety and this is stressful so don’t take it personally if I’m a huge bitch” but then was totally out of control with her comments and directions. They eventually got tired of everyone’s way of working, they kicked out everyone but their partner off the project for the day and then later apologized via email explaining the anxiety even more. Then the sympathies rolled in with responses. 

I did not have sympathy, I didn’t respond. I reached out to the original coordinator and forwarded the email to them, saying due to these conditions I will no longer participate. I mean, my anxiety kicked in at the idea of just going back in to finish helping. Plus it wasn’t a paid gig, it just was something to keep me out of my anxiety shell. 

I don’t know, it was off and I didn’t like it. Am I over reacting? I’m not questioning their anxiety, but “total bitch” is something I haven’t ran into with my disorder. Is this normal? If so I need to adjust my perspective of anxiety and be prepared for it if I’ll run into it again.

anxiety,1id47ik,Heavy weight in my chest,"Hi all, 

Just needed a place to vent. I've been at 2 jobs where the work environment has been toxic. Co workers trying to get me fired or they're addicts (alcohol or gambling) 
Workload has massively increased for me. I now have a heavy weight feeling in my chest. 

I struggle to get out of bed on time, and I struggle to keep on schedule with work. I have nothing else left to give at work. I am burnt out. 

My anxiety caused me to disrespect a woman's boundaries (I cared about her very much). She no longer wants to talk to me and tells me that she's happy without me in her life and is preparing to see someone else not even 2 weeks after she broke things off with me. This is brutal and soul crushing. 

I hate this feeling because it follows me home from work and has caused me to mess up a good thing with a woman I cared about. People say hell has no fury like a woman scorned, but people don't know the pain of a man with a broken heart. 

I know I'm not a failure, and I'm trying my best, but life is difficult at the moment with this weight on my chest. I hope I feel better soon. ",1,2025-01-29 21:49:01,2,1.0,SilentShart95

Here's the kicker. My dad had a heart attack at 32. And he was not ""fat"" as his doctor described it, by any stretch. He is intensely paranoid and stressed that's bad for his heart. He also smoked two packs a day easy.

Now here I am. Gonna be 26 in a few days. I had a horrible panic attack, totally thought I was dying. Seriously, totally convinced it was over. My bloodpressure skyrocketed, I couldn't breathe. My girlfriend drove me to the ER. As my hands and feet went numb I was thinking to myself ""dying isn't so bad. Billions of people have done it before me so it can't be so bad."" I was literally mentally preparing myself to die. 

I get to the ER. The Triage nurse (bless him) immediately recognized what was happening, spoke to me calmly, and walked me through breathing exercises. Within 10 minutes I had almost completely calmed down. I was fine. Totally fine. 

This wasn't enough for me though. I needed to be sure. I went to a heart doctor, explained my family history, and they agreed that while i am still young, it'd be safer to do the tests. So they do a nuclear stress test, a heart ultrasound, they scan my blood and make sure my blood flow is good. They made me wear a heart rate monitor for 48 hours. Then after all the testing was over I waited for the call in petrified fear. 

Then they called.

""You're totally healthy. Your heart is strong and there's no evidence of any blockages. Lose some weight and you'll be okay.""

For a week I had no anxiety anymore. I did feel some relief. But now it's back. I keep thinking ""what if they missed something?"" 

I'm so tired of living every day in fear. I want to be able to go to work, hangout with friends, live my life without this overwhelming dread hanging over me. 

I'm not asking for a reassurance. What im asking is, have any of you ever experienced this? Have you beat the anxiety? And if so how did you do it.

Thanks guys. ",2,2025-01-29 17:05:30,4,1.0,Deatthstar

anxiety,1icwyo8,My living space doesn't smell like my living space and it's freaking me out.,"My roommate had someone they're seeing over yesterday and they're here again today. 

I don't mind them having people over. But now that I'm thinking about it, the only other person they've had over was someone I was sort of somewhat familiar with. 

Also, this guy has a really strong smell. It's like when you walk into someone else's house and you're hit with the different smell all compressed into one person. 

I couldn't sleep very well last night because I could still smell him. Today I went to class and I come back and he's there again and I had to leave the place as soon as possible because I couldn't feel safe with where I live not smelling like it's supposed to. 

I don't want to tell my roommate that they can't have their partner over. He doesn't seem like a bad guy at all either. But I'm sitting here with my stomach churning feeling like I'm about to throw up and like I'm going to cry because I can't feel comfortable in my own room.

Edit: I had forgotten a notebook and so I made an agreement with myself that if I had leftovers from lunch I'd go  back to my room to put the notebook away and put the leftovers in my backpack but I was in such a frenzied state I forgot my lab goggles and now I can't go to my lab because I'm too late. I have to use my one free absence, so now I basically have no more ""sick days"" for the lab which is also freaking me out because what if I am sick in the future? 

Also I popped open the window to try and get the smell out.",2,2025-01-29 16:54:51,0,1.0,Fyre-Bringer

anxiety,1icwulm,(Attempting) to break the morning anxiety cycle,"Soo woke up at around 9 today. Meant to wake up at 10:30. 

Unfortunately when I woke up I felt a surge of anxiety and existential thoughts — which make me very anxious because I confuse it with being in danger. I haven’t dealt with existential thoughts for awhile and now that I am having them again, I just had to tell myself that no I’m not crazy, it’s just existential thoughts. This resulted me in being calm

Then, I started feeling anxious during a meditation. Like I felt more anxious near the end then I was in the beginning. I picked up my puppy, and just let myself cry with frustration for a sec. 

And oh my god, did that puppy do wonders to bringing back to the present moment. Licking my face, biting my fingers, pulling at my shirt. It actually helped. 

And now it’s past 10:30, and I’ve been in bed for all this time. And I am not in bed bc I feel sad — it’s because I feel paralyzed by all of it. Granted, I don’t have anything till later today, but staying in bed will only continue the cycle….

I am going to attempt to just get up and get myself together a bit.

anxiety,1id2egd,SNRI W/o the Trippy Visual Side Effects,"I have been on Effexor (Venlafaxine) since Aug of 2018, 6.5 years now. Has worked great for me for GAD (generalized anxiety) & overall mood.  However, some side effects of course. All tolerable but one.  I would get “visual trips” so to speak.  I’ve heard other people refer to this side effect as hallucinations as well.  

Anyways, it would happen a couple times a month at least, typically at night but has happened during the day.  I would be able to see every crack & crevice on the walls, ground etc See every dirt spot.  Everything white or light was super exasperated & everything dark was super dark. It was like hyper focused vision so to speak & tunnel vision.  Was hard to focus on anything else. There’s some more detail but that’s the gist of it. This would last anywhere from 30 min to several hours (usually the latter). Usually, since it happened late at night it would take me falling asleep & waking up the next morning to be gone.  

Finally, after dealing with this for 6.5 years (been happening more frequently lately), I told my doc I wanted to stop Effexor & try a different SNRI. He prescribed Pristiq. Well before I took it, I read other reviews of similar trip like side effects with Pristiq as well.  So I decided not to take it & just get off SNRI completely. First week was feeling good. Now 2 weeks in & last 3 days been feeling irritable as hell, short fused, every little thing pisses me off etc Basically, back to square one.  

So I’m here to find another SNRI that works like Effexor without the “visual trip” side effect..

I’m aware of the 5 main SNRI..

-Effexor 
-Pristiq 
-Cymbalta 
-Fetzima 
-Savella 

Send me your experiences with any of these & or others that I may not know of & side effects they may have..

I will also share answers to any questions you may have as well.  Thanks for reading!

This anxiety has been causing strained eyes everyday. In the morning it’s fine, but by noonish, my vision becomes strained. It’s hard to focus them and the strain gives me headaches. There are no other issues with my vision besides the strain.
To help, i have been avoiding screen time, spending hours with my eyes closed and lights off, exercising, cold and warm compresses,and meditating for 1-2 hours a day. While this has helped my anxiety, it hasn’t stopped the eye strain. My eye doctor confirmed there was nothing wrong with my eyes so I’m sure it’s psychological.

anxiety,1ickkr6,Absolute nightmare. I'm ashamed and I feel like there's no solution,"I'm 21F and I started sobbing in class. I have a professor that likes to joke and pick on people. He hasn't necessarily done anything too rude to me yet but I am consistently terrified of him and his jokes. Today while he was taking attendance he read my name incorrectly. He's always said it correctly before and the way I wrote my name on the cards he uses for attendance/picking is hard to misread imo. It's written in all caps and the letter he mispronounced was an A. He replaced it with a U. I'd understand mistaking a lowercase 'a' for a 'u' but not a capital but I digress. 


He mispronounced my name and I responded with the correct name. He repeated the mispronounced name and I repeated my name. He said 'i guess they aren't here' and I just stayed silent. He continued with roll and got to my friend who said 'shes here btw' and he said oh why didnt you say anything. 
I may be imaging thinks bc I'm so anxious in that class but I felt like I heard laughing and i got extremely embarrassed. I started to tear up and my face got really red and blotchy and I started sweating profusely. I held in my tears to the best of my ability but the professor and a few students noticed. Some of them kept turning back at me while I was trying to hold it all in and it was making everything worse. My friend next to me didn't realize I was crying so she tapped me to tell me something and I didn't react. She tapped me again and I turned to her and she realized I was sobbing and started asking if I was okay and if I needed to leave and I just couldn't hold it in anymore. I started crying and hyperventilating, still attempting to be quiet. I stayed in this classroom for 36 minutes fighting back tears before I had enough courage to get up and leave to go to the bathroom. 

I finally left the room and went to the bathroom and calmed down. I tried to go back and started crying again in the hallway so I returned to the bathroom. I finally returned to the classroom with 10 minutes of class left. My professor was kind enough to skip over asking me questions because I was losing my shit.
After the class dismissed and everyone left, I talked to the professor and he apologized and asked what happened and sort of agreed to be less of a nightmare for me. I also apologized and expressed that if I could control myself I would, I wish I wasn't this way. Mind you, while I'm telling him this I'm nervously laughing and smiling while also actively crying. 

I'm just embarrassed at the whole thing and it ruined my day. I hate the impression I give people. I even chose to take my public speaking class in person so that I could try to force myself to get over people acknowledging me. I did so terribly every single time. Red, sweaty, voice weak and shaky. The first time I presented my professor was grading me and I made eye contact and she gave me a look of pity. I'm 100% positive I only passed that class because she felt sorry for me. She gave me nearly a perfect score on every presentation despite the scoring being based on your voice being loud and clear and making eye contact with the audience, both of things I should've got 0s on at the very least.

anxiety,1icz34x,Issues with blood pressure readings and doctor,"Issues with blood pressure readings and doctor due to past attack

Hi all,

Back in August, I had my first full blown attack: I’m 24m and was getting my blood pressure taken at a clinic. I had just gotten back from a wedding where I drove my family 4 hours up the day before and 4 hours back that morning. I’ve had issues with getting my BP taken in the past (read 140+ systolic pretty consistently at age 20 at my previous doctor, even when retesting at the end of the appointment) and they directed me to a cardiologist who made me wear this ambulatory monitor. I read fine over a 24 hr period. I could have told them I freak out every time the cuff comes out, but they were being cautious and I don’t blame them for that.

For a while I was fine, then August happened and I totally freaked the hell out. My systolic was upper 130s, but my heart rate was pretty high because I was already bugging out. They wanted to monitor it, and eventually it went down, but I was spiraling at that point. I took the monitor off my finger and went to go sit down on the floor in the bathroom lol. I came back for the rest of the appt, they said they wanted to take it again at the end of the appointment (the doctor came in to the room to see me splashing cold water on my face). It was a really brutal experience and even the thought of taking my blood pressure at home stresses me out after that.

I figure my heart is probably fine, but the problem is the memory of that attack is preventing me from going back to the doctor’s. I honestly feel like if they tried to put a cuff on me or a monitor on me I would rip it off.

Have you guys ever gone through something like this, and how did you get over it? I can’t even put my finger on what I’m afraid of. I think it’s just going to that place again where it feels like a bomb is going off in my head and I have no sense of control",1,2025-01-29 18:20:48,4,1.0,gyromaster99
anxiety,1iby7t5,If you have anxiety & derealization - read this.,"Hey,

I don’t even know where to start. But one thing I do know is this: I know exactly how you feel. I know what it’s like to wake up and feel the anxiety creeping in before you’ve even opened your eyes. I know how it feels to sit in a room full of friends, smiling, while inside you’re screaming for help. To feel like you’re watching yourself from outside your body, like you’re trapped in some messed-up video game. To have the same intrusive thoughts come back day after day, like a broken record you can’t turn off.

And most of all, I know the fear of never feeling “normal” again.

But trust me on this – you can get through this. I’m 22 years old, and I spent over a year living with generalized anxiety, panic attacks, PTSD, and derealization. I hit rock bottom. I couldn’t even go grocery shopping without breaking down. I thought my life was over. But I’m here now, writing this message with a clear mind and a full heart, telling you: You are stronger than you think.

Let me break this down for you in a way that helped me. Imagine someone addicted to cigarettes. They didn’t start smoking a pack a day overnight. It started with one cigarette, then two, then ten. It became a habit.

Your negative thought patterns work the same way. Over time, your brain has become addicted to feeding these thoughts, spiraling into worst-case scenarios, and overanalyzing every little thing. It’s like lighting one cigarette after another without even realizing it. The more you engage with these thoughts, the stronger the habit becomes.

But here’s the good news: just like you can quit smoking, you can quit feeding your anxiety.

It’s not about getting rid of the thoughts altogether – because just like you can’t control someone offering you a cigarette, you can’t stop the thoughts from popping into your head. But what you can control is whether or not you engage with them.

Here’s how it works:
	1.	A negative thought shows up.
	2.	You give it attention.
	3.	You start overthinking it and panic: “Oh no, here we go again!”
	4.	And before you know it, you’re right back in the same cycle as every other day.

Sounds familiar, right? But here’s the thing – step one is out of your control. Thoughts come and go. They’re just random, like clouds passing in the sky. You can’t stop them from showing up. But steps 2, 3, and 4? That’s where your power lies.

The next time a thought pops into your head, try this: notice it, acknowledge it, and let it go. Tell yourself, “Okay, I see you. But I’m not interested. I’ve got better things to focus on.”

At first, it won’t feel easy. Just like quitting cigarettes, you might “relapse” and give in to those thoughts sometimes. But every time you catch yourself and choose not to engage, it’s like saying no to another cigarette. Each small victory makes you stronger. Over time, you’ll realize those thoughts don’t have the power they once did.

Now let’s talk about those places and situations that trigger your anxiety – grocery stores, crowded spaces, anywhere that feels “unsafe.” I get it. I know how tempting it is to avoid them. But here’s the deal: the more you avoid those places, the stronger the fear becomes. It’s like telling your brain, “Yep, this is dangerous.” And that creates a conditioned response.

So what do you do? You face it. Slowly, step by step. It’s not about being fearless – it’s about showing up despite the fear. Every time you do, you’re rewiring your brain, proving to yourself that you’re capable.

And now for the practical stuff:
	1.	Exercise – especially cardio
I’m not exaggerating when I say this saved me. Go for a run, hit the gym, do anything that gets your heart rate up. It’s like a reset button for your brain. Try doing it first thing in the morning. You’ll feel like a different person after.
	2.	Eat better
This one’s simple: you are what you eat. If you’re constantly putting junk into your body, how do you expect to feel good? Start cooking healthy meals. It’s a small change that makes a huge difference.
	3.	Quit nicotine
I vaped here and there, thinking it was harmless, but it made everything worse. Seriously, if you’re using nicotine, stop. It’s only adding fuel to the fire.
	4.	Limit your exposure to negative content
If your TikTok feed is full of people talking about their anxiety and trauma, delete the app. Surrounding yourself with that energy every day isn’t helping. Focus on things that inspire you, not things that keep you stuck.

If you’re wondering what helped me the most, I’ll leave you with this:

There’s a book called Don’t Believe Everything You Think: Why Your Thinking Is The Beginning & End Of Suffering. This book was a game-changer for me. It taught me everything I needed to know about breaking free from the cycle of overthinking and fear. If you’re serious about getting better, read it.

I’m rooting for you. Take one thing from this post – just one – and put it into action. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you have questions or need advice, drop a comment. I’ll do my best to help.

You’ve got this. I see you, and I believe in you.

I went to the bathroom to try and calm myself down because I really didn’t know what was happening- when I was there I like sat down on the floor and breathed a bit. It helped a little and I was gone for like 10min.

I just want to help my family financially. I don’t care about fame or popularity. ",17,2025-01-29 02:50:20,3,0.95,Jpoolman25
anxiety,1icyckt,Need advice and help for social anxiety.,"So in 2021/2022 I was the laughing stock of my whole year level. And my dad died that same year. A particular group of kids got out of their way to make my life hell in person and online. Ever since then I’ve had really bad social anxiety and depression. Every time I go into school my anxiety shoots to the roof. I’m scared how people will look at me, talk about me.

anxiety,1icy4uv,Psychologist or psychiatrist?,"So for context I really struggle with anxiety. I feel like over the years I've slowly gotten over the mental aspect of it, although I do struggle with a bit, it's not as bad as it used to be. But no matter what I do the physical symptoms have never gone away.
I'm in college so whenever I even hear the word
""introduction"" or ""presentation"" | freak out.
Whenever I feel like l'm put on the spotlight, I start to shake, sweat, my heart beats faster, etc.

I went to my primary care doctor and she said she couldn't prescribe me anything such as beta blockers because it's not her area of expertise, but she did diagnose me with episodic paroxysmal anxiety. She sent me to the ER with a referral and said they could give me meds there. Went to the ER and they said they can't give meds either and they referred me to a psychiatrist, but the PA told me l'm better off contacting my college's psychologist because they can prescribe medicine and the process isn't as lengthy as going to a psychiatrist.

But I thought psychologists couldn't prescribe medication? I'd prefer not to go to a psychiatrist because I'm afraid this'll go on my record and I'l struggle getting government jobs if I ever decide to go that route, but at this point I'm starting to consider going if it's truly my last option.

Any advice would be appreciated 😞",1,2025-01-29 17:42:50,1,1.0,YingXingg

offmychest,1ief6eg,I am married to a racist white supremacist and I feel trapped because we have kids,"When I met my husband he, of course, was on his best behavior. We live in a white-ish part of the country so there were few opportunities to notice his beliefs. But that came through in time, especially after we got married. 

Lately, he is even more vocal and almost celebrating that white boys are finally about to be ""respected and valued"" again. I don't think it's wrong of him to want to be respected and valued but he has made multiple racism comments and that makes me just not feel safe around him anymore. It's only a matter of time until I am in a vulnerable situation around him and who knows how he will treat me then? 

If we didn't have kids I'd divorce in a heart beat. But I don't have any family  I can rely on, so for the sake of my kids' basic needs being met I feel that I have to stay married. 

I cringe every time he wants to have sex. I think I can endure it but I feel sorry for myself and I feel stupid for having been charmed by his charisma.

offmychest,1ie7npe,Boyfriend lied about why we broke up until we got separately raped.,"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) broke a few months ago because he was too busy and told me he that I felt more like ""friends with benefits than a girlfriend"". I dumped him after he said this because I never felt that way at all. After our break-up he seemed to be struggling with his mental health a little bit so I contacted his mom saying me and his friends were becoming concerned. After this happened we remained friends but not overly close, then classes went on a winter break. During this break I was roofied and raped by a close friend, it was very violent but I was blackout drunk. After classes resumed I saw him again, and we had a shared class so I saw him around more often and since he knew the friend I decided to confide in him. That was about two weeks ago. Fast forward to today and someone comes up to me and tells me this horrifying story about how my ex-boyfriend had raped one of our mutual acquaintances, however this individual had been known to lie in the past about these kinds of things. I confronted him about and the whole truth came out about everything. He had been raped while blackout drunk as well. He also didn't break up with me because I felt like ""friends with benefits"", it was because he so depressed he wanted to commit suicide and he didn't want me to be ""the girlfriend of the boy who killed himself"". I am so unbelievably surprised that now only did we both experience the same horrifying experience, but the fact that that's why we actually broke up. I am not sure if I am angry or upset or just sad. I think I might just be sad, there is a lot to process and I just need to talk about it somewhere.",1274,2025-01-31 06:20:27,18,0.98,OneEnvironment8206

She teared up as she thanked me and went to get her daughters meds. 

She eventually returned, got checked in and as she was walking to her room she thanked me and said, ""you saved a life today,"" and I damn near cried hearing it.

I went down to her room a few minutes later to offer some cookies and I learned 2 things.

1. That her daughter is autistic and nonverbal but knows sign language. 

2. From how she was acting and some of the things she said, she's most likely a victim of domestic violence and just trying her absolute best to keep it together for her daughter.

offmychest,1ieg3xk,I got married last week and all the attention went to my wife and very little to me,"My wife and I had been engaged for a little over a year and during that time, we had been planning our wedding. I was genuinely so excited for the day and I was very much involved in the planning. I went to look at venues, I tasted the food, worked with the wedding planner, invitations, photographer, flower arrangements, everything (except for her dress lol). I feel like we did everything together as a team. 

Last week when family and friends started to come into town, so many people started making comments about it being “her” wedding and “she” did a great job planning and it was “her” dream day. I was blown away by how many comments I got that were along the lines of “guess she’s dragging you here today!” When I protested (jokingly as to be nice), I was responded with basically a “ok sure bud.” Lots of comments also basically saying that my freedom is gone and the fun in life is gone for good now. 

My wife even started to notice and she would make comments about all that I did to help and it was our day, but these comments persisted all weekend. Even after the wedding and through this past week as people made posts on social media, everyone made comments about how beautiful she looked (which is so true btw), but literally no comment about me. I worked hard to look my best that day, but literally no comments about how I looked (except from my mom and my wife). 

I get it, weddings are mostly about the wife and it’s generally more important for the woman, but I guess I was just a bit bummed when I really realized it. It’s done and over and I’m only going to vent about this anonymously on the internet, so it is what it is. ",132,2025-01-31 15:34:01,46,0.83,Ethereal_Imagination
offmychest,1ie92r3,Husband just landed a massive salary...,"So, my husband just landed a new job with a salary that’s honestly the highest I’ve ever heard of for someone our age (25+). The number is huge—like 'am I rich now' kind of huge. We’re a young couple, doing okay with good schools, decent jobs, and all that, so there was never anything to complain about to begin with. But now, I am kind of blown away by how much he can earn.

On one hand, I’m happy for him—I love a man with ambition and have always known that I married one. But on the other hand, I’m nervous.

In years to come, he’ll be earning much more than me, and I can’t help but feel a little unsure about what that means for us. Growing up as a good student in a middle-class family, I learned to follow a linear path—step by step. But now, his money might change where we live and how we live our lives.

For example, when I complained about work, he started saying, “If you don’t like it, you can quit. I can afford for you to do whatever you want in life.” He’s super confident about being able to provide for both of us, and I’m honestly kind of in awe of that. But it also scares me because I was raised to believe in working hard at a job and sticking to a clear career path.

I get that he wants me to feel free to explore whatever I want, and I know he loves me a lot, but it’s just hard to wrap my head around this shift in our dynamic. The idea of not having to worry about money sounds like a dream, but at the same time, I’m not sure how to handle the role reversal. Plus, I just don’t know how to react to the income difference and what it might mean for us as a couple and for raising a family down the road.",533,2025-01-31 07:54:42,73,0.92,Hairy-Mushroom3500

For weeks I’ve had this bad feeling, felt something off. For weeks I’ve assumed it was because my mental health hasn’t been great, that I couldn’t trust my own perception and gut. For weeks I assumed I was the problem, honestly for months I’ve felt that way. That’s part of what has added to my mental health crashing. 

I don’t want to put a ton of detail, because she has no idea I am aware yet. She should be aware, because the people she shared her nonsense with are my friends. That confuses the hell out of me, she must know it would get back to me? Why not just break up with me? Why this? 

And the saddest part, I’m heartbroken, I’m angry, and I’m fucking relieved. That was surprising. But after being made to feel batshit insane for months, being told my perception is off because of my mental illness, being told I’m the problem, having affection withdrawn, then given back… being taken advantage of for my money in the end. 

I’m fucking relieved because it’s over, because I am not crazy, my perception isn’t fucked, and I certainly am not the only problem here. 
Of all the shit, I will never forgive her for making me feel crazy. 

We were trying to rush a marriage, because we are gay and things are so uncertain. The only reason we aren’t married, is I needed a prenup. Thank fuck for that. Thank fuck my mom drilled into my head that I had to get one to protect certain assets. The funniest part is I finally found a lawyer, I actually met with her recently to get the prenup going… and today I’m instead going to be talking to her about how to protect myself as this relationship ends. 

I have no idea how to confront her, but I’m a let her fully enjoy her little trip this weekend. It gives me time to plan and figure out my exit.

offmychest,1iep2ku,Would You Date Someone in a Wheelchair? I’m Lonely and it sucks.,"




Hey Reddit,

I’m a 30-year-old guy navigating the ups and downs of dating as someone who uses a wheelchair for longer distances due to cerebral palsy. It’s been challenging to meet women and build connections, and I feel like my disability often overshadows who I am as a person. So, I’m here to ask:

Have you ever dated someone with a disability, like a wheelchair user? If so, what was the experience like? If not, would you consider it?

I’ll be honest—dating as a wheelchair user can be tough. On dating apps, it feels like people only see the chair, not the person behind it. I wonder if there’s an assumption that being in a wheelchair means I can’t be intimate or lead a fulfilling, adventurous life. For the record, I absolutely can—in every sense of the word. Yes I can still have sex. 

Ladies of Reddit, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Would you date someone who uses a wheelchair? If you have hesitations, what are they? And if you’ve been in a relationship with someone with a disability, what helped you navigate the unique dynamics?

For me, using a wheelchair doesn’t define my life—it’s just a tool that helps me get around. I’m independent, driven, and love having deep conversations, sharing laughs, and going on adventures. But I admit, I’ve hesitated to bring up my disability early in relationships. I worry it might discourage people before they even take the chance to get to know me.

I’m reaching out to better understand how others view relationships with someone like me. Have you or someone you know dated someone with a disability? How did you handle conversations about accessibility, intimacy, and other challenges?

I appreciate any insights, advice, or personal stories you’re willing to share.",18,2025-01-31 21:55:19,25,0.91,The_DynamicDom

My friends who work for the clinics that help our community’s kids won’t have jobs. 
Every patient I serve, where will they go? 
What about the 5 year old with the degenerative disease who probably won’t make it to 10? They only get this short time with him and what’s going to happen to their quality of life?! Who’s going to help them with his communication device?

I’ll go down in all of this too, but it’ll take longer for me. What do I do in the meantime? How do I help?

offmychest,1iedbfr,"My husband betrayed me, we're not talking and I feel like I'm frozen and overreacting over a kiss","I want to preface this that I am new to Reddit. Sorry for any mistakes.  

This is basically just me screaming at the void as I have no one to talk to and writing is my second nature. Never psoted anything though. Lately I have discovered Reddit and have been reading other people’s stories to disassociate from my own. I’ve been in some kind of limbo/hell for a month. Some of which is my own doing. I am nowhere near perfect. 

I also know this is very long.  

Me (f 43) and my husband (m 45) have been together for sixteen years.  

Well, I call him my husband and he calls me his wife, but we are not actually married. We are engaged though. This is quite a common practice in our country, to be together for a long time, or engaged for a long time, without getting married. Maybe because the custom is that when you get engaged you buy engagement rings for both the man and the woman. Both of us wear engagement rings. It’s a symbol of our relationship. Maybe not pertinent info but, moving on.  

We are not rich although some of our friends are very well off. But we've always done ok. I'd still say we are working class though. We can pay bills, we have food and we do things we like, but we rent our flat and we can't afford vacations without saving for years. I am content with that. It is so much more than what so many people have. 

Relevant to this story is that we met on New Years Eve, our first kiss ever was at that stroke of midnight, and we got engaged on New Years Eve, so it is also our anniversary. Doubly, you might say. And ever since that first New Years Eve we have always been together for that night, whether at a party, at home and on one occasion in the ER. And we have always kissed on the stroke of midnight, wishing the other a happy anniversary and a happy new year together while toasting each other with some bubbly if available. 

That is until this New Year.  

To really tell you why and what happened and why I am here, sharing with a bunch of strangers I need to give some background.  

My husband and I have always had, as far as I know, a good relationship. Not perfect by any means, but we share love and respect and he's never done anything to purposefully hurt me, nor I him. We have had ups and downs and our fair share of arguments over the years, but we have always agreed on the big things and shared a common set of values and standards for how we conduct our lives. We do not have any children, and we never intended to and have been happy in that choice (all of this is as far as I know, and what he's told me). 

My husband’s BFF John (m 45) and his wife Mary (f 45) have been our closest friends for a long time. They got together about 10 years ago now. Before this John was chronically single. We've done a lot of things together. Trips, holidays celebrations, activities, and many a sports event. My husband likes football (soccer for the US crowd) the best, I prefer basketball or hockey, but we all attend most matches together. I mention this as it plays a small part further on. We have shared a lot of things with our friends, and I consider them both family. Neither my husband nor I have any siblings.  

Now John and Mary have been going through a lot. They always wanted children but have not been able to conceive and the stress and pain has put a strain on their relationship. So much so that they are currently separated. It's been relatively amicably, but it has changed the dynamic between us for sure. I am really close with Mary, and my husband and John go back to his school days before we met. It has been hard for us seeing the people we love hurt so much, so we have tried not to take sides and just be generally supportive. My husband and I have talked about this a lot between us, but naturally I and Mary engage more with each other and my husband and John do as well. I adore them both and am heartbroken for them, but such is life. I hope they will come through this better on the other side, together or not. 

I think that is enough backgrund to set a clear picture.  

For this New Years Eve, hubby and I were invited to a couple of our friends to celebrate, as they were having a party. Both Mary and John were invited too but only Mary chose to attend. Apparently, John was down with something according to hubby. They have not actively avoided each other in social settings so I am inclined to believe this, but who knows. I could understand if they didn't want to cross paths.  

The evening was lovely. A large house festively decorated. Lots of good people, good conversation, good food and a moderate intake of alcohol. No one was getting loud or drunk which is important to note. Just cheery and happy. My husband and I are by no means attached to the hip although we spent more time socializing together than apart during the evening. I was talking to a friend when the champagne was being poured and the glasses handed out. Someone announced that midnight was mere minutes away, and I realised I had lost track of time.  

Naturally I looked around for my husband but could not see him. Our frinds house is rather large and the party was spilling out of the living room onto the glassed terrace and the large kitchen, so I moved around looking for him thinking that he was looking for me. Suddenly everyone started counting down from 10 and I ended up ringing in the first new year since my husband and I met, alone. I was probably more upset in that moment than I wanted to admit. I felt childish and since I'd sort of lost track of time myself, the same was probably true for him as well.  

A minute or two later I heard his voice saying ""there you are"" behind me. I turned, smiled, admittedly expecting a kiss. He just pecked my cheek stiffly while frowning and said he'd been looking for me. I said I had been doing the same and that I was sorry we missed our kiss. I can tell you, the kiss on the cheek had felt more like a slap. I felt struck. There was no hug, no kiss, no Happy New year from him. I told him Happy New year and happy anniversary and raised my glass to toast him. He just looked at me and then at his empty hands and said yeah, then mumbled he'd put his glass down.  

By now I felt like crying. Not over the missed kiss as the bell tolled, but at his strange and distant behaviour and I was starting to get a little suspicious feeling nagging in my heart. Also, I was second guessing myself because he has never given me any reason for suspicion or jealousy. It is not something that has been a part of our relationship. I just nodded and felt the need to get away from him. I handed him my glass and headed for the bathroom. It was at the end of a small corridor/hallway and was luckily empty. I locked myself in and tried my hardest to calm myself and not cry. Did a few deep breaths, ran my wrists and hands under cold water and calmed myself enough to venture back outside.  

As soon as I opened the door, I saw Mary standing there. I thought she was waiting to use the restroom at first and told her it was all hers. She had a very odd look on her face and was avoiding looking directly at me. She said she just wanted to say she was sorry. I'll tell you my stomach dropped, a big lump of ice forming spreading through my body. I said nothing, my throat aching. She said she'd seen us (hubby and I) and she could tell I was upset. She said she understood. She said she just felt awful and needed to apologize immediately, that she never wanted this, and she felt sick. I just stared at her, wondering how bad it was, as my husband had said nothing.  

Finally, after practically gaping at her, I pulled myself together and asked her to explain her side of what happened, desperate to know. She told me coming to the party felt like a mistake. She said she felt lonely living alone in her and John's flat and she couldn't face sitting at home so she still decided to attend even though he might be here. She'd been relieved when he wasn't. She admitted it had been harder than she thought seeing him socially when everything between them was so fragile.  

To be honest I was wondering when she was going to get to the point and felt far from sympathetic. I think she sensed this. She told me she had suddenly felt anxious at the party. Everyone being so happy and cheerful, she felt unable to join in and to get a bit of space she had left the common areas and slipped into the empty bedroom of one of the teenagers in the house, intending to sit out the countdown and the cheers at midnight. Just after she’d sat down on the edge of the bed my husband appeared in the doorway. He'd seen her slip away and wanted to check on her. She said she was fine but needed a breather. He'd sat next to her, offering to talk, and she told me that she told him she didn't feel like sharing.  

She said he'd distracted her, talking about football, since the two of them were the more avid fans among us, and apparently the room they were in had several team flags and things as decorations. She said she missed going to the games and hadn't kept up with how the team was doing or the league lately, and they had talked about football apparently, until they heard the countdown to midnight. She had stood and said he'd better get out there and to go find me. He had stood too, but by then the countdown was almost finished and as everyone shouted Happy New Year my husband had put his hands on her cheeks and kissed her and then told her happy new year. She said she was in chock and just left. Then she'd seen him approaching me and seen our interaction and seen me upset. She told me she still felt in shock and nauseous.  

I think she told me the truth but by now I was in chock as well. She repeated how sorry she was. Told me she should have stopped him, and she should have pushed him away, and she didn't know why she froze and repeated how sorry she was. We were in the hallway but the front door by now, blocking the restroom was not optimal. She just looked at my face and said she was leaving and asked if I would tell the hosts. She didn’t even grab her coat from the washroom where all the coats were, she just left. 

I don't know how long I stood there. It felt like ages. For some reason, I then went and found the host. Told him Mary had gone home and asked me to tell him. I told him I was tired and felt unwell and would be going too. He looked at me with concern as I thanked him for the evening and asked him to relay my gratitude to his wife as well. I didn't see my husband anywhere and I was relieved. I didn't know what to say. I just left. Grabbed my coat and walked out of there, expecting to walk home.  

I actually managed to waive down a cab (on new year’s, what are the odds?) and was home within 10 minutes. We did not live far. At home I felt like a robot. I fed the cats, showered, brushed my teeth. Did only the most basics. Took about 20 minutes tops before I was in bed, feeling sick to my stomach and pain in my chest. Five minutes later I heard my husband coming home. If he'd left right after me and walked the timing seems right. Maybe he left a little later and took a cab. I don't know. Didn't ask. I pretended to be asleep. Heard him in the kitchen talking to the cats. Feeding them again because they acted starved. I didn't care. I just felt so utterly betrayed and alone and sad. I couldn't cry, though. My eyes ached as did my throat, but nothing came. I heard him turn on the TV in the living room and I fell asleep before he came into the bedroom. He didn't check on me. Talk to me. Tell me what happened. Explain himself. Nothing. 

Now I want to make clear, that from what Mary told me, nothing up until the kiss would have upset me. Well, missing our supposed kiss stung a bit, sure, but not if he told me why. Not if they had rejoined the party, he'd come to me kissed me and said he forgot the time, I'd been fine. He could have told me why later. All would have been good. 

I just feel utterly betrayed by the kiss and everything that took place after. He actively chose to kiss her instead of me, and I don't know why. I still don't.  

I guess because of that kiss, he acted weird with me instead. He didn't talk to me, and I haven’t talked to him about it. He still hasn't told me anything. I am numb. He is a bit quiet and distant but trying to act as if everything is normal. But he won’t attempt to touch me as usual, so even if I knew nothing about this, it is very apparent. Other than that, he does what he usually does. Tells me where he's going if he's leaving. Sits by me on the couch and watches the same shows. Talks to John every day (don't know if John knows). My husband has not confronted me, but he must know that I know, right? 

I know this is not healthy or mature of me. I am not acting like a reasonable adult. It's been a month of this and all I want to do is rant and scream and cry, or just get an answer why, but I am just frozen and numb, and I think I have fallen into a deep depression. We have never not talked about things. We always communicate reasonably well. I don't know what he thinks I know or don't know.  

I know I have a lot of trauma, from my childhood and the time before him. Especially concerning betrayal. In my country it's hard to get help to see a mental help professional. It's all very strictly regulated, and I can't afford to seek out someone at a private practice. And before this, I haven't felt the need. My husband was always my rock. We talked about everything, or so I thought.  

I have been working as much as possible. I've been doing overtime and started walking to and from work to get out of the flat. By commute it’s 15 mins one way whereas walking is 45 mins. When I'm home I just sit with my phone doomscrolling. I go to bed before I'm tired. I get up far too early to avoid spending any more time in bed with him.  

I feel like I am overreacting.  

It's ""just"" a kiss. As far as I know, he didn't sleep with her. As far as I know there has been no affair. So many spouses have been through so much worse. I feel I have no right feeling like this. But then the question that keeps popping up is: why kiss her if he doesn't have feelings for her? Why kiss her, on our anniversary, at midnight, instead of me, if there is nothing there?  

I've been wracking my brain to see if there have been any signs over the years, but I draw a blank. I trusted him and he never gave me any doubt. I have never snooped on his devices or his e-mail even if I know his passwords. Not even now. But now it is not because of trust, it's because I am afraid of what I'll find. 

I haven't heard from Mary either and I have made no effort to contact her. I feel guilty about that.  If what she said was true, I don't blame her for anything. I never meant to leave her alone with this, but I really can't be a crutch for her when I’m not functioning myself. My mind just keeps racing. Wondering if there is more behind her separation than I knew? 

Are they in love? Will we be separating too, now? I don’t want that. I don’t. I want him to love me. Inside I feel like a child desperately crying for her mother. Crying for him. For him to make it right. To comfort me and hug med and tell me he loves me. Although, I have made no attempt either. I know this is wrong. 

I can't believe this has been my life for a whole month. I don't know how to break through this fog and this frozen state... I don't know how to move at all. 

I just can't face this. I don't know what to do. 

  
Edit to add TLDR. Had to google what it was. Sorry.

TLDR: My husband kissed our mutual female friend at midnight on New Years eve which is also our our anniversary/celebratory kiss. She confessed and apologized after. He said nothing and acted weird, and we haven’t talked about it since. I feel deeply betrayed but I am frozen and can’t seem to make myself do something about it. ",44,2025-01-31 13:08:01,53,0.84,spicy_sesame_elmo
offmychest,1iejo8o,"I think this is it, I NEED to end this","Hi everyone. I'm F, in my early twenties. When I was a teenager, my mom made my life a living hell. She would say such terrible shit to me that I'd sob myself to sleep every night. I have written tons of notes on my notes app from under the sheets about how hurt I am or written books where the main character is just as fucked as me, to get my feelings out of my chest. 

I joined college and most of my time was spent outside. Then lockdown happened. Whole day with family. The way she would compare me to my sibling hurt me the most. My sibling is the golden child, my mom absolutely adores them. But me? I was the worst person to walk on this planet according to her. I understand. Maybe I am a piece of shit.

But I'm not. I really am not a bad person. I have always been good to everyone, as much as possible. I tried my best in school, I tried my best in college and I'm trying my best at work. I'm a hard worker, I never say no to anything. Even if it sucks the life out of me, I still do it. I always be there for my friends, who also just use me but I still remain true. I always help out my colleagues. I never behave wrongly or rudely with anyone. I care for everyone, I care so much. I always feel empathy for everyone. I pray for the less fortunate always. Even when I'm upset and I'm sad, I try to be cheerful and try to bring happiness to people around me. My colleagues would describe me as the clown if asked. In short, I'm only making my parents proud. If I had a daughter like me, I would've been proud and happy.

After I joined work and stayed out most of the time, things died down. Her lectures and terrible insults became once in a blue moon thing. She would fight with me, but not so much. But today she again burst out like a volcano. The same terrible insults and abuses. It took me back to my teenage years. The little me crying under the sheets. I became her once again. My eyes, ears, forehead and cheeks hurt because of crying. My throat is scratchy due to yelling. My will of living going to 0 once again. But this time, its for the last time, I hope.

I really don't see any point of being alive. My dreams crushed due to some of my silly mistakes. My family, whom I loved and cared for the most, hate me and think of me as something I'm definitely not. What do I even do with my life? Ok. I would've tried to get out of here and start a new life, but its impossible. I don't have money and I won't even earn so much that I can move out or run away. Only my death will bring me peace and peace to my family hopefully (or I'm sure, I'll get blamed for ruining everything by killing myself after my death, lol.)

I just want to die. Please, let me die. Put me out of this misery.

offmychest,1ie5b99,My mother just walked in on me masturbating & didn't even apologize or leave 💀,"I was having my fun time, didn't know she'd be home so early.. Anyways next thing I know she opens the door without knocking, I curse out of surprise & ask her to leave because I was in the middle of something, she straight up says ""no, that's your problem"" & CLOSES the door behind her. I keep trying to ask her to leave & keep trying to tell her that I was in the middle of something private & didn't like the way she just walked in without any remorse, she eventually leaves but fucking hell I feel so uncomfortable.. I just texted her & asked her to knock next time because that made me extremely uncomfortable, I am yet to get a reply back 🧍‍♀️ I'm a little bit pissed about this, I like my privacy & she not only invaded it but crossed the boundary even when I told her to leave, so I feel very embarrassed & even a little bit humiliated. 

Edit: but can the comments be a little more professional please? In no way was my mother sexual towards me & in no way is it appropriate to over sexualize me the way some of these comments are, this is only directed to **some** people..",207,2025-01-31 04:08:16,126,0.86,Calyp_1
offmychest,1ielnd6,My mom says I love you now and it pisses me off,"So lately, my mom has been ending calls with ""I love you,"" and honestly, it’s been throwing me off. She’ll call me just to tell me some random shi, and then outta nowhere, she hits me with an ""I love you"" before hanging up. Like??? Ma’am, where was this energy when I was a kid?? I don’t ever remember her saying that to me before. Now, all of a sudden, she’s affectionate? Bro, it’s so awkward. I have to force myself to say it back, but it feels fake as hell. 

Because let’s be real—this is the same woman who told me I complain too much. The same one who acted like I was too sensitive when I was sick, who told me I should be more like my older brother who doesn't tell her when he isn't feeling well. BRO, I WAS A CHILD. WHO ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED TO GO TO?? The neighbors??? The government??? And now she wants to act all soft, like the years of neglect just didn’t happen? Like, am I supposed to just forget all those times she made me feel like a burden?

And the worst part? I feel guilty for feeling this way. Like, I should be grateful, right? She’s my mom, and she’s finally showing love. But it just doesn’t feel real. It feels like she’s only doing it because she knows I’m not a kid anymore. Like it’s some last-ditch effort to fix something without actually acknowledging that it was broken in the first place.

I don’t know, man. I don’t hate her, but I also don’t know how to just accept this like everything is normal. Because it’s not. And I don’t think she even realizes that.

I saw a comment on another post that said basically the title. Saying DEI means just about as much to the average person as if you say FQX (this is a made up acronym as an example by the way to emphasize the point). 

If we talk about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: say Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We need to make sure EVERYBODY knows exactly what is going on and what is being attacked.

offmychest,1iejrlu,I plan on dying at 30 because I feel like I’ve finished life,"Posting from an alt but I feel like I’m kinda…done with life. I’ve gone through middle school, high school, and I’m in the latter half of college. I feel like I’m kinda…done with life. I’m not depressed or suicidal, nor do I hate my life. I just feel like I’m sorta…done. I don’t want kids (and before anyone try’s to tell me that I may: I’m gay and I **REALLY** don’t like kids), I don’t have any career aspirations (why the hell should I care about working myself to the bone to make a multi billionaire even richer?), and I certainly don’t feel like I have any greater purpose in life.

I feel genuinely FINISHED and FULFILLED with life. All I’ve ever wanted was friends and I’ve got that. It’s not like I’m gonna be waiting for some big series to end cause all the series I was following throughout my life has ended and I’m finding it increasingly hard to find new things enjoyable in general.

I just feel like I’ve already reached a satisfying conclusion. Like I’ve finished the movie and I’m just watching the credits. I genuinely don’t feel like I want to continue on.

Again: I’m NOT suicidal. I don’t feel depressed and I’m not going to actively try to die. I just feel like when I hit 30, I’ll ask a doctor for an assisted suicide and die.

offmychest,1iepur7,I couldn’t hurt her physically so I hurt her socially. I’m so sorry,"When I was 13 I had a friend who for the most part I was really cool with. We would talk and hangout all the time and I considered her a good friend. The only problem was that she used to try to make fun of the way I looked sometimes. 

Nothing was wrong with my appearance and I had started having boyfriends at this time so I was at least decent looking but she however didn’t get the same attention and a lot of boys were mean to her. Because of this I always defended her and let boys know that I would not let them treat her badly. Despite this she would try to take personal digs at me. 

Every so often when she did this I would just stop talking to her for a day and then we would get over it. However there was one last time that I had had enough. I let my mom do my hair once and I was sitting in class minding my business when she had came it and said that I looked like a grandma and laughed in my face. This got me so upset that I got up and (this is so stupid and I cringe every time I remember this) tried to push/shove her but she was way bigger than me and stronger so that didn’t happen (pathetic I know). After this I figured if I couldn’t hurt her physically I could get her back emotionally/socially.

After this I just stopped talking to her completely. We had to sit next to each other in class and lunch and whenever she tried to apologize to me I ignored her which made our friend group ignore her too. I told people not to talk to her and anytime a boy was mean to her I stopped defending her and laugh with them. Once I even reminded her that the boys only sat next to her because I was next to her, that they were there for me and not her.

By the time we graduated she had no friends. I had completely isolated her from our peers. To this day when I think of this I shudder at the thought of how horrible it must have felt to be all alone on graduation day. 

Gianna, wherever you are I am so sorry, I was such a coward and a loser. I wish I hadn’t treated you so badly and it is one of the things I regret most in this life. I wish I had just walked away from you instead of hurting you so badly. I’m sorry I tried to put my hands on you and you had every right to defend yourself because that was uncalled for. What I did to you was way worse than anything you did to me and I am so so sorry, I hope to one day see you again to apologize for being a scummy person to you. I have changed a lot since the last time we talked and I hope you healed from all that I put you through. Wherever you are I hope you’re doing well.",4,2025-01-31 22:28:12,3,1.0,blooooooop_
offmychest,1idzqq1,My dad died in a tornado 12 years ago today.,"I was 15. It was January 30th, 2013 and I was in ISS (In School Suspension, basically detention before school ended for the day. Unsure if it's a common thing outside the US.) The fire alarms started blaring and kids were rushed to the hallways and under desks, huddled in the fetal position, waiting out what we assumed would be a small storm. Within a couple hours the category 4 tornado devastated my tiny hometown; took roofs off of factories and put them in the highway, destroyed most of the trailer park surrounding my (separate) Trailer, injured over two dozen people and displaced hundreds more from their homes. Among this, my father was unable to escape the destruction. An old Black Walnut tree was pulled down atop my childhood home, my father lost his life, and about three hours after his body was excavated I was taken by my Foster Family to retrieve what I could from the wreckage. I was already in foster care for truancy at the time, and the last time I ever saw my dad alive was in a courtroom waiting room four days prior. I was told by my social worker that I could be in the room for my Mom and Dad's custody hearing but I was forced into essentially a daycare room and promptly escorted back to my foster family. I never got to say goodbye, no hug, no I love you...I miss him a lot today guys. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

offmychest,1ieh1c9,I Wish I Died in My Car Accident,"I was hit by a semi-truck a couple of weeks ago during hazardous road conditions. I spun out into another car and ended up in a ravine. I was rushed to the ER. My car was totalled but I escaped relatively unscathed. 

I was deemed not at fault. No one was seriously injured.

I was even told I was lucky to be alive because the truck hit another truck first which softened the impact. 

But, ever since, I have been massively depressed and have wished that I either died or got seriously injured in the accident. I don't feel lucky to be alive at all. 

I don't have any inclination to self harm but I've been struggling since the accident. 

2024 was an extremely rough year for me. Lost my job, wife had an affair, got divorced, moved in with family, etc... (This was all in a previous post)

Towards the end of 2024, things started to look back up. I got a new job, started dating again (under direction/advising of therapist), hung out with friends and family more, started playing sports again. I was actually in a decent place all things considered.

I was hoping 2025 was going to be better. But, ever since the accident, I'm having trouble doing anything but wallowing about how much life sucks and has been totally unfair. 

2025 has started just as crappy as my entire 2024 was. The accident is just dragging up crap that I had already put in the rear view. It's a ton of pain that I finally escaped (for the most part) and now it's back and I don't know if I can honestly handle it again. 

I barely eat, barely sleep, I'm not allowed to work out because of the accident, I don't have anyone to play board games with, and my video game friends have been busy lately. I drive a lot for work, so I just wallow in self-hatred and doubt nearly constantly because I'm alone all the time.

Tonight a friend of mine played a few songs with his band at a concert. He had told me months ago and I thought it was important to him, so I made sure to come. I saw they were selling merch, so trying to show my support, I bought a top and put it on. And then I stood around like an idiot. At some point, after walking by me many times, he stopped and said hi - that’s it. He had plenty of time before and after the concert, but chose to spend it with other people who are probably closer to him. Alrighty.

I went home somewhat sad and frustrated, but told myself it’s okay and he is probably just busy. Then I made the mistake to open Instagram and saw that my other friends as a group were hanging out without me. They did not know i had plans tonight, and yet none of them reached out to me.

Both times, things got better in the short run and not in the long run - this just being yet another example.

Before I was conceived, my dad wanted my mom to abort me, and for the longest time I was raised by my mom with a relatively absent dad. Now, just because I was effectively raised by a single mother did not mean my mom was a great mom or even a great person. Around my adolescence to tween years I lived with my mom, but after that I moved in with my dad.
 My mother is a narcissist, and she often used physical force and verbal humiliation as punishment without ever trying to talk me through any bad behaviors(she did this in public at times too). I can tell she at least tried to raise me; she would often buy me clothes and shoes but would always get angry if I don't wear what she wants me to that day. Oftentimes, I felt like I was nothing more than a dog to her; she'll dress me up how she wants and when I misbehaved, she would simply beat me up. Growing up like that messed me up, and at one point in my life I struggled to make friends because I was practically a mute.

My dad worked for the government, had a lot of money and you wouldn't be wrong if you call him a womanizer. But for all the shits he had done, he did take some responsibility for when I was born. He wasn't very present during my younger life because at the time I was 1, my half sister was 12 or 13. My dad basically gave my mom some money and told her to use that money to raise me (she barely did, 90% of that money was spent on her interests and hobbies, while I got the cheap stuff). But in the end, I still went with my dad because, frankly, both my parents are shit. But if both are shit, then you'd just have to pick the less shitty option. 

My mom never respected my privacy or cared about my interests, but my dad did. My mom never asked me about my day or if I was having troubles at school, but my dad did. My mom never taught me anything about personal hygiene or basic household chores you need to do, but my dad did. Fuck, my dad was the one who taught me how I'm supposed to properly wash myself after he realized I stinked balls after months of me just using a soap + water concoction to shower everyday. 

When I went to live with my dad, he helped me a lot with many aspects of my life. When he realized there are some things he just can't help me with, he actually asked someone to help me with it, instead of just letting me rot away with my problem. Slowly, my previous issues were being resolved on their own. I became more social and much more cheerful. 

I thought my life would only get better from there, but when I finally met the rest/most of my dad's side of the family, it finally struck me that no one wanted anything to do with me. Sure, they'll talk to me and stuff, but I can tell they really don't want me there. I have two half sisters, and I guess the rest of the family got weirded out by me because of the prospect that my dad was in fact, in the wrong for cheating on his wife. As his child, of course I would side with him over his wife over the dispute of the house. But the rest of the family? No, from their perspectives, they're most likely more inclined to side with my dad's wife. Afted all, it was him who cheated, not her. From the family's pov, I literally just moved into the house my sisters used to live in, moved into one of the rooms they used to inhabit, and eventually, if everything goes to plan, I'll inherit the house. (Both of my sisters have permanent residency overseas) Perhaps to the rest of the family, it just seemed too easy for me to just randomly pop up and be able to do all that with seemingly no repercussions.
 Maybe that's why they're so queasy when talking to me? I don't know. I didn't ask to be born illegitimate like this, if I had a choice I'd rather be aborted instead. It's saddening to know that no matter how hard you try to connect, people would actively avoid talking to you. Hell, I literally got told to go back to help with the cooking (with only myself in the kitchen) while everybody went to take fucking pictures during the holidays. They don't want me there, and no matter how hard my dad pushes them to interact with me, there's no point. I am just an illegitimate kid after all, why should they care? It's just one kid. After all, they don't know me like they did my sisters, didn't grow up with me, there's like a (at minimum) 16 years difference between me and the rest of the family. 

It's fucking terrible and a lonely ass existence having to live like I should be hidden away until it's time for me to finally leave, even though I've tried countless times to build a bond with my dad's family. They just don't care enough to bat an eye. In a way I resent them, because it's not a choice I made to be born like this, but I understand why they'd be that way. 
Would I act like them if I ever met a situation like mine in a family function in the future? Hell no. I'd rather be waterboarded and tied to a the back of a running truck then treat anybody the way I was treated, especially not to a young child.

Honestly this whole thing feels like a rant about nothing, but I just needed to get this out somehow. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, and during family gatherings practically everyone avoids me like the plague. But I'm still trying my best to be more optimistic about things, and I hope that this brings some level of comfort for anyone who even relates to my story in any way.

offmychest,1idhgo1,I Was Kidnapped And It Ruined Me,"I was drugged, kidnapped and raped by the maintenance man from my apartment complex and was failed in every single way possible. Anytime I tell my story online, I get bullied relentlessly and I get so sick of it. I didn't get a nationwide manhunt like Elizabeth Smart or Kara Robinson. I had to go through this all by myself and when I was free, I tried to do everything right. I asked for a rape kit and immediately reported it to the police. But the police didn't believe me and were extremely defensive over my rapist.

I've tried working with advocacy groups, but my case is so complex because the police don't believe me that there's not much they can do. The apartment complex refused to hand over the security footage and never even got in trouble for it. I never got victims compensation either. I actually had to pay for the bodycam footage--I literally had to pay to see my rapist. I'm in severe medical debt because I have permanent injuries from the rape. I have a fundraiser to pay off my medical debt, but I just get hate for it.

I'm so frustrated...it's not fair. I'm in therapy and it's helpful, but it doesn't change what happened. It's not sustainable to live like this and I'm so tired. I don't have the support like the other survivors--no family. Idk, I just wanted to vent.",3251,2025-01-30 08:17:20,70,0.99,bodyisntmine

I am so sick of healthcare doctors and insurance not paying attention to what their patients tell them or having to pay an exorbitant about. (Almost $600). We struggle as is since nowhere around my town will hire me and she’s unable to work at all because of her pain issues and lives of a barely living able retirement paycheck.

offmychest,1ieg65m,I self-sabotaged a retreat I attended because I didn't want to be there,"Two years ago my wife asked if I would attend a retreat for Catholic men that was supposed to help grow in faith and some other benefits. I had no interest in it, but finally accepted to make her happy. I'm Catholic, but not ""super Catholic"" and don't have any interest in extra-curricular activities involving religion, especially with other people. 

I decided that if I were going to attend, I would not participate in anything and just try to float through the whole weekend just to get through it.

Everyone was nice, and I was nice to them. I was never an asshole to anyone. I just didn't want to be there. So for every presentation, I just stared straight ahead, not paying attention, just trying to keep my eyes open. I had no idea what anyone was talking about. They told us to ""take notes,"" and during these things I would look around at everyone scribbling things down, and I'm holding my pen saying to myself, ""what is everyone writing down? Take notes on what?"" Suddenly I was back in grade school, having to ""take notes"" and just like before, I had no idea what to write down;

After each talk, each group would discuss what was said then present it somehow. I let everyone else at the table talk. When the leader looked at me and said, ""What about you, alman54, what were your thoughts?"" I would just stare at him, then look down at my empty notebook page, trying to remember a single thing that was discussed. I had no answers. I didn't care. The leader would then pass and ask someone else.

This was how it went the over two days we attended it.

Even if I weren't self-sabotaging, it was the most boring weekend I had ever endured. We had to go to bed late, get up super early, so I was already tired and cranky from lack of sleep. It also rained hard and continuously all weekend long, so I couldn't ever go walk the ""beautiful grounds"" surrounding the retreat center. 

I DID participate in one activity that included acting and putting on a little ""play,"" and I did that because I was a part of it, and everyone liked it. 

At the end, the presenters put up a giant poster for our retreat group and asked everyone to sign their names. I signed my name the biggest in the lower middle, just like John Hancock did. 

Overall, I went in with a bad attitude and less than optimistic about the experience. I came out of the experience somewhat annoyed, unfulfilled, and aggravated about the weekend. As far as anything Catholic that came out of it, well, I'm basically the same as I was before, just a lot more jaded now.",8,2025-01-31 15:37:01,1,0.84,Alman54

offmychest,1iej99y,My girlfriend is making me worried,"I am worried about my future with her as her parents come in the way of our relationship. 

Look, I’ve met her parents and I go over to their house a lot as well. Her dad is very nice to me but not very much towards his own daughter for some reason. Her mom is just… horrible, a terrible mother from what I’ve heard from my girlfriend herself, but she doesn’t think that’s considered “horrible”, she never questions her parents behaviour. It’s like an abuse situation since young and they’re just raised to think that’s normal. To me and my closer friends that I talked about the situations to, they all agree to what I have concluded. 

Now how does this affect my relationship with my girlfriend: we are Asian, and her parents is very old fashioned, especially her mom. And she is controlling as well, she has this controlling tendencies but is not the type that are in control of the situation. 

Apologies for my lack of context and my inability to explain things with clarity, English is not my first language and I’m trying not to disclose too much informations, I really wanna get this off my chest. 

I love her so much, but whatever is in the way really is giving me more reasons to not stay. She’s immature because of her parents, she’s incompetent of a lot of things also due to her parent’s lack thereof teachings, she doesn’t understand a lot of what we might expect to be “common knowledge” because she says no one ever told her that. She explain to me there’s once when she got her period during 13-14yo and she started vomiting a little, her mom scolded her saying she’s pregnant and all. She even explained that she feels like her dad is the type to “let outsiders teach you”, that’s why her parents doesnt like relay much knowledge or wisdom for her and her siblings. (Fyi: my girlfriend is the eldest, and her younger siblings are super spoiled, and disrespectful towards her)

She’s 19 now, and she doesn’t buy her own bras or undies, her mom does all the choosing even if the cup sizes are not exactly it, her mom buys pads for her as well, and her mom doesn’t look if the pads are good or functional, she just looks at the price whichever is cheaper and it works, so be it. It almost just feels to me like her mom just doesn’t fucking care at all and I hate it. Is this the type of family I have to deal with when I marry my girlfriend? And she’s so stuck in this incompetent stage of her that i havw to deal with it so much it’s so stressful for me. It stings me I keep tearing up thinking about it.

offmychest,1iephu6,Being called quiet and shy.,"People are always like, “but you’re so quiet and shy.” I hate being called that with a passion. If I do talk then they just act uninterested so what’s the point? Or they say something sexist, racist, homophobic etc which is enough to make me question their character and whether or not I should even interact with them. I pick up on the shit they say. Or ya know they prove to be a shitty person so I was right to be “shy” around them.

I don’t go and call them immature, socially unaware (a lot of them are) or whatever other flaw I notice. Funnily enough, the same people who have called me shy and quiet get all uncomfortable when I have to tell them I’m adopted (literally just a fact about my life) when they ask.

From what I’ve seen I feel like people don’t think about why I could be shy. Like they say something and then they’re like ‘oh why isn’t she talking to me’? Where’s the self-awareness? Is everyone around me just oblivious as fuck?

offmychest,1ie4sc1,My mother discouraged me from getting on birth control.,"
Getting on birth control when I was younger was one of the best decisions I ever made. When I look back on my life, I have plenty of regrets, but one thing I never regret is not having a child before I was ready. Having the time to grow into myself and figure out who I truly am—without the responsibility of raising another person—was essential for me.

When I was 18 and just starting to explore my sexuality, I made the decision to get on birth control. My mother, however, discouraged me and was disappointed that I had taken that step on my own. Birth control was never something she introduced me to or even discussed with me. Instead, I had that conversation with my primary care physician—on my own—just before turning 19, when I started becoming interested in sex. Looking back, I truly believe that if I hadn’t taken control of that decision myself, my life could have turned out very differently.

When I eventually did lose my virginity, my mom told me it was the worst day of her life. Sex was never an open topic in our relationship, and birth control certainly wasn’t either—even though she got pregnant at 16 and had me at 17. Our birthdays are only four days apart, and I’ve seen firsthand how much her life deviated from what she had once dreamed for herself as a little girl.

And I’ve learned this isn’t a religious thing but more of a repression thing. I just wish things had been different. ",49,2025-01-31 03:40:03,15,0.98,DeerParkWaterFan
offmychest,1idqoin,"Just so you know, I know you’re married (using a throwaway account for this one)","You said you wanted to keep it casual. When you talked about her the one time, you called her “your kids’ mom.” No shit. I found your wife’s Pinterest profile. I knew it was her because her profile photo includes you. And also your children. But it’s frozen in time from years ago, probably right before you moved here. Her smile is so big and beautiful and bright. Yours looks halfway out the door. You told me you weren’t together, that you were separated, but that board told me something very different. Her pins were a lot like mine would be, if I had a board. DIY, recipes (funny she has so many, since you do food for a living), travel (the places you went together), fashion. I saw the hundreds of pinned workout routines. Was she feeling inferior? Did you make her feel less than and like she needed to fit into a certain mold after having all of your babies? Was she trying desperately to win you back after you’d run halfway across the country to some big shot job and left her in the country? Was she trying desperately like I’ve been trying? There were quotes — quotes about taking chances, living life to the fullest, being brave, getting messy. But my personal favorite was the one board dedicated to you, on long-distance love, its challenges and triumphs, and how you’d forever changed her life. That board was entitled what I’m pretty sure is your pet name, and I’m tempted to call you that in my final message to you. Never have I felt sicker faster than seeing that. The past few days, my stomach has been in knots over you. I now know why.

My heart has been trampled on a lot over my lifetime. I’d have to say this takes the cake as far as romantic relationships go. My heart initially hurt for me. But it hurts infinitely more for her and for your kids. Does she know this is how you are? Does she know you lie to other women about her? About your status? Does she know she’s being lied to every day?

The extended holiday trips out of town and long periods of time with no talking make perfect sense now. I thought you just had a stressful job and needed to unwind--that’s what you told me after all. And I always wondered about the selfies you sent me. So many selfies. No man has ever sent me selfies on this level. Smiling, furrowed brow, eating ramen, at work, at home, inside, outside, upside down. Who else are you sending them to? And how many?! I started temporarily saving them to view the timestamps and locations. You think you’re smart, but I’m smarter.

I see everything you post online in your self-righteous charade of fooling people into thinking you’re good and that you care. You don’t have any social profiles other than LinkedIn, and I think that’s so you can f*** around under the guise of professionalism. I see the same carousel of women liking and commenting on your posts now. You’re on there so you don’t have to admit to having a complete family waiting for you several states over in your giant house, while you’re here making a mockery out of God knows how many people. How many fools were there before me? How many other fools are there now?

You started to pull away. I guess I got too easy, too open. I started reflecting—what was wrong? How could I improve? Was I not interesting enough, fit enough? (I see the same spiral on your wife’s Pinterest.) I truly panicked. I thought you’d found someone else and were giving chase (you do love to hunt). And that may very well be true. If you did it with me, you’ve surely done it with others and will do it over and over.

I thought I wasn’t worthy of your time and attention. I see now that you’re not worthy of mine.",322,2025-01-30 17:21:01,37,0.98,EuphoricSkill9345

offmychest,1ien1ba,I feel unloved,"for as long as i could remember , it's always been myself

I wasn't hated, but I wasn't loved either

I had come to terms with that when I was very young, I thought I'd be fine with it 

but I started making friends when I got into college in my mid teens 

it was the best and worst parts of my life 

it hurts, being shown constantly what I could never have 

I could talk about everything for hours, it's what I do everyday, but thinking about everything all the time. my brain is overwhelmed, I can't really give an example on the tip of my tongue. but that just means that I get to spiral over and over, and the emotions and memories hits fresh and hurts like it just happened yesterday.

Ive always seen love around me, even before Ive had friends, I saw it in the shows and the comics and the things that I had loved. but those were fictional characters, fictional stories, i knew it was real but it didn't effect me, I wasn't thinking about me. 

but then, I started seeing it in my friends. I saw it in the way their parents picked them up and dropped them off and fed them and gave them money and let them go to the doctors. They got to get diagnosed and help and meds and support. They got to be carefree and they lived in their own bubble, they didn't worry about anything except for handing in their assignments in time. I know everyone has struggles, but they got to have help and love and support with their struggles. 

they had each other, and I was just a friend due to proximity. 

it hurts, but I was so happy to have friends.

then I moved to university, then I was alone again. 

now that I wasn't around them, who reached out to me? 

no one, they weren't friends with me, I was just a friend they had

it hurts, but I had bigger fish to fry. at 17 I was in a foreign country, all alone, no parents to support me, and not much money. figuring out how to do international stuff was hard when my college didn't help me, I didn't mind living alone, rooming with strangers, I didn't mind being in a new country alone, Ive always been alone. but it scared me, I didn't have a safety net, I could've easily fucked up. and then what? 

but I didn't fuck up, and for a year I was alone. it hurts, but thinking back on it now, it didn't hurt as much as when I was around the people I loved. i was alone, and of course I wanted friends and family and love, but I had my interests and I had myself. 

then some of my college friends started going here, our college and the university I'm currently going to has a partnership, I was the first to go to the University through that partnership, I had to figure everything out, they only reached out to me afterwards to ask for help with the process. 

but i was happy to help, I like being helpful. one came first, they were supposed to come in on my second semester, but due to some visa issues that they overlooked they couldn't, so they got in my third semester. The third semester was a short semester, it was extra credit classes, so the next semester, 2 other people came in. So those three were all in the same class, as it's the first ""real"" semester the first person had. 

but even though I was here a year before them, I was in the same classes and semester as them as well
why? because apparently, the uni and college had fucked up. I was supposed to get credit transfer for the first two semesters, but I was told otherwise, and I didn't know until the others told me they got credit transfer for the two semesters that I already took. I asked the management and they said some bullshit about how the information came this year, and I came in last year, etc etc. my heart shattered. after emailing backs and forth, I was able to get a refund for what I spent those 2 semesters. But that didn't give me back my time or money I spent on living costs.

but more than that, I broke. 

through it all, Ive always been excluded. 

all Ive done was help the others, and they've excluded me. 

over and over. 

first person (P), second person (F) 
P lived with me when they first came here, and is still living with me. P made friends, I wasn't too hurt because it's their friends not mine. but when F came, P included F in everything, they went on hangouts with P's uni friends without me. got a job together when I've been talking about getting a job with P for months before this, etc etc. I got them the apartment, I handled all the legal stuff, I manage the bills and rent and talk to their dad to organise the finance. I take care of the place, always cleaning up after both of us, + F + friends that come over often. friends of P and later on F, that I was never included in. I cook for all of them. I helped them with everything, from coming to the country, to getting a place, to living, and even academics. all the whole they had their family and parents come to the country with them and help them with everything too.
 
F would call with friends from our college, and during the calls, they would talk about how much they miss P and F and how they can't believe they're gone now.
no mentions of me. 

they're older than me, they got into college earlier than me but graduated later. I prided myself in getting into college when I was 14, I was supposed to get my degree by 18. but I got fucked over by the uni and myself. 

then they were here, failed and retook so many classes in college, and they didn't care. they were so carefree, they always had a safety net. and they've always had their friends. they had something to miss back home, talked about how much they missed their family and friends. how they missed having free stuff and home cooked meals prepared whenever, how they didn't have to do any chores. and it hurts. I don't have anything to miss. nothing changed when I went here. it's always been just me. 

they don't know anything, they have no street smarts or how to do ""adult"" things, they didn't have to learn, they always had someone care for them or took care of it for them. even now it's me who's doing it for them. 

when F first came here, they said they were scared to do things alone and live alone. but they weren't alone. they had me helping them with everything, and aside from that they had P, and they had their family. I was the one who had to do everything myself. had to figure eveyrhting out myself. 

F said they felt left out around P's friends, and I get that, they're a new addition but saying that in front of me? the person they didn't even invite ? 

then when something happened with one of the friends they hung out with the most, they stopped talking to that friend and I started being with them more. they offhandedly mentioned/joked that I was the replacement for that friend. even though I was here first. even though I was here from our college. even though I helped them through everything. 
and it hurts. 

I don't mind handling the finance, I don't mind doing the chores, I don't mind cooking, I don't mind helping with assignments. but I want to be included. I want to be thought of. I want to be important. I want to be appreciated. 

before P and F came, I got a partner. my very first one. it didn't last long because they cheated on me. I never prioritised or thought about romantic love because I just wanted friends, and if i wanted a partner they would be my friend first. but when I met them, it was on my first semester, and I was so lonely. and no one had been so interested in me, and seeked *me* out. he turned out to be one of those childish people who needed romantic love at all times and would constantly change partners because they couldn't handle that a relationship needed work and effort, he just wanted the high at the start and lovebombed people. he cheated on me with my friend, wh I introduced to each other. when they broke up, she apologized to me. the main fault still lies within the man, but she was still wrong for that because she knew of me and they got closer when we were still together. they didn't waste any time to get together after we broke up, wanted to hurt me. after awhile, I didn't really care for him or the relationship. but the principle of the situation was what kept hurting me . I thought for once, I would've been the most important to someone. I would've been someone's priority. I would've been important. I would've been loved. it was my fault for rushing into a relationship, but it still hurts. it felt like the universe was slapping me in the face with irony and rubbing salt in the wound, showing me again that I am not deserving of love. 

I spent my 18 birthday the same as any other, alone and in anguish. Ive always dreaded my birthday, things always went wrong. not only that, but also because I kept hoping. 

even though the universe kept showing me I was not worthy of love , of effort, I keep and keep and keep hoping. and it keeps hurting me. 

even though none of my birthday's has ever gone well, I still hoped this one would be different. it was my 18th after all.. but alas it was a disaster. 

everything at this point seems to be ganging up on me, and i felt truly and utterly alone. everything was crashing down on me. all the bitterness I've had with my friends that I've tried so hard to bury multiplied and the hurt was like I've never had before. I didn't have my academics to reassure me because the first friend I've made in uni was the best student in class and was even more talented and had everything figured out, then I got fucked over by the uni, (and later on my current partner said that getting in early was normal for his country and nothing to be shocked about.) I was at the same level as my friends who didn't care about their academics. I didn't have any safety net, no family, no partner, no friends, and I was struggling financially while they were talking about how broke they were while having more monthly allowance than me, and having their bills and rent paid externally from their allowance by their parents. I was more capable than any of them, and I didn't want to be . I'm capable because I had to be, because if I didn't take care of it then who else. I didn't have the privilege to be carefree. all my friends had friends and I was surrounded by love that I was undeserving of and it hurts. it really, really hurts. they're good people, good friends, I just wasnt important to them..they didn't leave me out intentionally, I just wasn't important to them.

I want to be a child too. I want to be taken care of. i want to be loved. I didn't want to have responsibilities, I wish I could miss the past but there's nothing to miss. I feel so petty breaking down that my friends miss their home and have friends and don't need to do chores at home and have home cooked meals everyday, but I want the privilege to have these little things that everyone seems to have. i want to be a child too. they're years older than me but they get to still be a child. I want the privilege to not care, to be stupid, to be petty, to be immature, to be childish. 

I wish I could get medical help, I wish I could get diagnosed, wished I had the money to get the meds.

i now have a partner, and we love each other very, very much. but things aren't perfect, and I keep making things complicated and sad. and I'm so scared of losing the one person that has loved me. but I want more, I keep getting surrounded by the overwhelming love everyone seems to have for each other , and I want that too. I want flowers, grand gestures, thoughtful gifts. and everything hurts, everything still hurts. he doesn't care about valentines and holidays, but I want to be special and celebrated. birthdays, valentines,.. even holidays like Christmas where people celebrate friends and loved ones, even if it's not specific to the person, I just want to be loved. but it'll come another Valentine's where I see others have what I want.. and my lifelong dream of having a good birthday where I'm celebrated and I'm happy and I'm important and special will never come true, because my birthday is the same day my partner's mom died. I will never have a day that celebrates me. Ive given him more flowers than I've received, Ive made his birthday so special. I wish he would show me off more. but he's like me, we're alone. but while I have friends that hurt me, he has no one. so he can't show me off. and I understand that, I understand that he doesn't know how to do romantic gestures, I understand . but I still want . I go out of my way and I'm always thinking of how to make him happy and how to make things special and I wished he did that for me too. I see the loving gestures people do for their partners online and I wish I wish I wish and it hurts it hurts it hurts. I wish that he would Want to do those things for me, because I always want to do romantic gestures, and I search ways or when something comes across me I think of doing it for him or together, but he doesn't. and that's what I want. I Want him to do loving gestures. flowers, gifts, activities, anything to show that he Wants to love me and Wants to show that and Wants to make me feel loved. 

I recently came back from a trip to my home country, to fix some issues I had. and if I was him and he left, I would've seen him off at the airport and eagerly wait to greet him back. he knew when I was leaving and when I was coming back, but he left on a trip  the day after I came back. and we'll only be able to meet on Monday, where I'll be busy with projects as it's my final week. Ive tried talking to him but he didn't seem to understand why I was upset. I hate international stuff, I hate airplanes and airports and I hate going back. I needed him.. there's a lot more that I keep getting hurt by, small things, big things, everything hurts and it hurts like a stab wound and I cry cry cry until my eyes are sore and I wish I wasnt like this I wish I wasn't broken. it's all too much and nothing, Ive passed through my life in a daze, I experience the emotions vividly but my memories are all hazy. I can't think properly and I can't say what's making me feel sad because everything is, and I can't remember everything, then I remember one and then another and another and another and I spiral down down down and each memory and feeling feels so vivid and sharp and painful and new and it hurts and I want to be important and loved and special and understood. 

we get along and click so well with each other for everything, but when it comes to problems like this it's like talking to a brick wall, he just doesn't understand and it feels like we're speaking different languages, I hate not being understood and I hate having to prove myself or defend myself and Ive tried communicating and Ive always been the type to communicate but it just doesn't work. I feel like I've grown backwards, I knew I should be friends with someone before dating them but I went and rushed my first relationship, I know communication is important yet now I'm stuck hurting myself by not communicating, because communicating hurts more. I'm the type that can't shut up, so having my attempts at communicating shut down and getting ""punished"" for it (idk how to explain) Ive just been getting worse and worse, how can I move past something Ive never gotten over ? it's the same thing with all the other things, Ive never been able to get up from any of them because they keep kicking me down and hurting me. but I love him so much and he loves me so much and I'm so scared and it hurts and I don't want it to hurt, I want to have fun and love each other but he hurts me and it's not his fault but I'm so so so so hurt and it hurts and I can't get over it and I can't have fun . 

I know he loves me but I don't feel loved. I'm surrounded by friends and a partner that loves me but I've never been worse, I was happier alone. and it hurts. I wish I could be happy, but I'm selfish. I want more.i keep wanting, I keep hoping, and it's what keeps hurting me. I wish I could stop hoping.  

I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore, i feel like I've had so much to talk about but I've talked about nothing. Ive made a habit of talking about how shitty I feel but not talking about the issue because I've never wanted to hurt anyone, but now I can't talk about the issue when I'm speaking to the void. I can't think properly anymore. everyday is a haze and I feel like a rotting corpse mentally and physically. I know I am worthy of love, but the universe keeps trying to prove me that I'm not. and even though I keep getting hurt over and over, I keep hoping. I keep wanting. and it hurts wanting. I wish that I did believe that I didn't deserve love. but I want it..I want it so so bad. i want to be loved. it hurts. it's so close but so out of reach. all my thoughts, all my emotions, all the memories Ive kept close to my heart, they're all mush now, eveyrhting mixed together. always trying to grasp it, trying to remember, trying to say it, trying to get others to understand. they escape me, until they attack me all at once and everything is so clear and painful again. but there's too much to say, and nothing to say at all.im sorry for everyone who has known me. I wish I could be better. I wish I could die. ",2,2025-01-31 20:28:40,0,1.0,mrowwoof
offmychest,1iehiij,Im surprising my mom with a cruise.,"The past year has been a shitfest to say the least. She’s currently in remission from ovarian cancer plus my younger brothers seem to be pros at stressing her tf out. 

She’s the ultimate people pleaser even on her birthday she’ll make plates for my stepdad, grandmother, great aunt etc. Her being that last to sit down and eat on HER birthday has always pissed me off. 

This year I decided to just take her away for her day. I will be struggling a little but tbh it’s worth it in my book. I’ve seen her struggle raising the 3 of us so this is my small way of paying it back 

I can’t tell her until I finish paying for it also she would try to talk me out of it. I needed to get it out before I ruin my own plan ",3,2025-01-31 16:38:08,0,0.81,LittleStar318
offmychest,1idv57q,"The constant abbreviation of DEI is trivializing the racist, abhorrent policy that is being put into place. Say it. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion.","Let’s start by saying I truly did not know what the acronym stood for. I thought it was about employment and had something to do with immigration and other ethnicities but holy fuck. It’s very telling that the media is specifying in their headlines what this means.

There is absolutely no reason to be abbreviating something like this. You abbreviate mutual funds or long winded titles when people fully understand what is being shortened. In less than two weeks I have seen a Billionaire Nazi salute to the entirety of my country, the President pushing for holding undocumented immigrants at Guantanamo bay and mass deporting people?

This is a full scale attack on minorities full stop. 

We can debate all day about the economics and fairness of the specific legislation, but this is an immediately enforceable executive order. My representative does not get a say, and it needs to be legally challenged to have even a chance of reversal which takes months or YEARS. The damage will already be done. The reason is because it is wasteful? I know of 3 billionaires that wouldn’t even notice if they were taxed more to cover the cost. But instead they get cuts. This is not how a democracy works. This is not the America I want for the future. I am at a loss for words. My vote against all of this didn’t even matter.  

As a white male, who has had opportunities I may not have deserved, I am pissed. My yearly income is more than 82% of the country. Shit I make more than most households in the country. Everyone deserves the same leniency and opportunities I was given regardless of race, color, creed or beliefs.

offmychest,1ie8c8b,I’m starting to feel guilty about my past sexual experiences,"When I was 5, I was molested by my grandpa *my mom’s dad* for a few years until I was 7. I remember when I would visit my grandparents, he would lure me to his shed, or some other random room in their house, and he would sexually assault me. I don’t know if it was because I was too young or because I didn’t think it was traumatic, but I never really cared. He died when I was 7 so it just stopped, and I never really gave it much thought, in hindsight that experience probably made My sex-drive very high. 

 I tried to have sex with any boy I could just to feel any pleasure. I tried to get with my older brother but I think he thought I was being weird or dumb so he just ignored me. I turned my focus on one of my older cousins, and we had a on and off relationship for years. I got active with some boys at school, and even one of my managers when I got my first job. Gross I know but honestly I don’t know what I was thinking at the time. 


About a month back when I was having dinner with my parents my grandpa was brought up in the conversation, something about one of his cars. During the conversation my mom said “you know I never felt comfortable leaving you or your brother over there” when I asked why she said he molested her and my aunt multiple times when they were kids and young teens. My mom was tearing up at the table and said “ I’m just glad you and your brother were never put through that situation.”

She started to cry and my dad was trying to comfort her, I didn’t tell them anything about me and my grandpa, just to give her some peace of mind. For some reason halfway driving back home it clicked in my head, I was molested, and I started to cry. For the last few weeks i have been feeling shame and guilt about every sexual encounter i have experienced. I’m starting therapy soon so hopefully i can look past all this.",22,2025-01-31 07:03:02,7,0.96,SmartJazzy05

offmychest,1ier5hw,"He broke up with me, but still has feelings. I feel lost and don’t know what to do.","I’m not sure how to start, as this is a rather complicated story. I’m 22 years old, and so is he. We live in different countries, about 2500 km apart, and we were in a relationship for one year. We both live with our parents—I’m taking language courses, while he has long had a stable job in his country. During that year, we only saw each other twice; both times, I traveled to see him. After those meetings, we agreed that he would come to visit me during his summer vacation.

At first, everything was going well, and we were already discussing our plans—where I wanted to take him and what I wanted to show him. My parents were fully supportive and even willing to drive for four hours to meet him at the airport (by the way, when I flew to see him, I had to spend the night at the airport in order to catch the earliest train home). Then, a day before we were supposed to choose tickets—and just a week before my birthday—he told me he wouldn’t come because he didn’t have the emotional strength. We started a long conversation, during which it became clear that he had known for a long time that he wasn’t going to come, but he only revealed it at the very end. That was the first turning point when we nearly broke up. I felt extremely hurt, disappointed, and offended—because he could have told me sooner instead of waiting until the last minute. At that time, I fell into a state of apathy, or a mild depression; for two weeks I barely ate anything, spent my birthday in tears, and for a long time afterward, I couldn’t shake off the hurt.

I felt—and still feel—that no matter what state you’re in, if you realize that you rarely see the person you love, you will seize every opportunity when it arises. By the way, his parents were not against me coming; however, after I was on my way home, they began to scold him. Because of that, I couldn’t even go to see him, as his parents didn’t want to see me. This was yet another reason for my anger and disappointment, because after his vacation, we had no idea when we’d be able to see each other again.

Eventually, I managed to calm him down somewhat, because he really didn’t know what to do or whether to continue the relationship at all. At that point, I took on the role of a strict motivator, insisting that we would get through everything and that things would work out for us. But when he agreed to continue, I felt an overwhelming exhaustion. I was left uncertain about what to do next. Still, if he had any scruples about staying together, I was confident in my decision—I was just deeply disappointed by his actions and drained by the tumultuous days filled with our lengthy conversations about everything.

In the end, I began to harbor resentment toward him, and for a long time I couldn’t call him affectionately or show any tenderness. Every day I hoped it was all just a terribly misguided joke and that he would eventually come and surprise me, but no miracle happened. For about two to three months, I cried almost every day because his actions hurt me so much. After that, I began to calm down and gradually let the situation go, although the lingering pain remained inside, and I would still, from time to time, recall that situation and feel sad.

At that moment, the only problem was that we didn’t know when we could meet next—more precisely, I was ready to travel to see him every day, while he either didn’t have the time or the opportunity. He still hadn’t talked to his parents about me because, last time, he nearly got completely embroiled in trouble with them, and he was afraid it might happen again. I wanted to speak with his mother myself (his stepfather is Italian, so we basically couldn’t find a common language in the literal sense) to show that I wasn’t as bad as they might have thought—that I didn’t want to be an enemy to their family and that I wanted to build a relationship. I didn’t need them to accept me or love me, but at least not to hate me. However, he didn’t want me to talk to her, saying that it wouldn’t change anything.

In the end, we hadn’t seen each other for eight months, and I missed him immensely—I longed for a meeting. I started talking with him again about meeting up, because I wanted to at least come for his birthday. He said, “We’ll figure something out,” “We’ll try our best,” and so on. There was no certainty or concrete plan in his words. He still needed to talk to his parents and somehow arrange for them to agree to my visit or propose an alternative.

Then a situation similar to the previous one occurred. A few days before his supposed conversation with them, we had a small fight, but by the evening, we made up and everything was fine. After all, who doesn’t argue in a relationship, right? The next morning, it was obvious that he woke up in a rather bad mood. I sent him a TikTok video with a cute quote about how everything will be fine as long as we don’t lose each other. In response, he said he wasn’t in the mood for that. I asked him if he disagreed with the message in the video, and that’s when everything started…

We ended up having another long conversation, during which he said that we had different life goals. “You want to start living together and see each other frequently, while I would like to live for myself, develop, and get a better job.” Damn it—why couldn’t he have said that earlier? Yes, people can have different goals in life, but when you enter a relationship, you start building shared goals and intertwining your lives. Why should I have been strung along if you had no plans to build a family? Why did we even start this relationship? And “see each other frequently”—seriously? We only saw each other twice a year, and if that’s considered frequent for you, I shudder to imagine what it would be like if we lived in the same city.

Ultimately, because of these “different goals,” he decided to end our relationship, while still claiming that he still loved me. I tried to compromise by saying that we could delay building a life together and at least meet during our eight-month separation. I said that if he wanted to take some courses, learn something new, and devote more time to himself, that wouldn’t be a problem—I would support him in all his endeavors. But he had already made up his mind and didn’t want to discuss any compromises. He reiterated that he didn’t have the emotional strength to “carry all of this.” Even now, it sounds so ridiculous, because we both invested in this relationship—we tried to give each other gifts from afar just for the sake of it, not only on holidays. We supported each other and always listened when one of us was hurting, as much as needed. We both worked on our relationship—it wasn’t as if he was carrying everything while I didn’t care at all.

It has now been almost a week since we broke up, but we still maintain minimal communication at my initiative—I asked that we at least say “good morning” and “good night” to each other. Perhaps I’m acting wrongly by not cutting off all contact immediately, but I still feel the pain. I still love him, and deep inside there remains a small flicker of hope that he might change his mind and come back. Although I understand that if such a possibility ever arises, he would have to earn back my trust and start over from scratch. That might be even worse than last time because this time, if he wanted to reconcile, everything would have to begin with a meeting to truly show his willingness to do something. Of course, the likelihood of this scenario is very, very slim, but I don’t want to lose him… Despite everything, we are so similar in almost every way—in our views on life, in our taste in music, humor, and many other things that I can’t even fully express right now. It feels as if a piece of me has been torn away, because we were so alike and being with him made me feel so good.

Perhaps I haven’t written everything yet, because I still have so many thoughts in my head and I still can’t fully accept the situation. If you have any questions, please ask, and I’ll try to answer them.

Right now, I still feel so hurt and lost, and I don’t know what to do next. I know that if nothing changes, I’ll eventually get through this, but I just don’t know how long it will take—I’m currently experiencing all these emotions and this pain.",1,2025-01-31 23:23:37,0,1.0,Far_Employ_4260
offmychest,1ier4st,My boyfriend never told me he loves me,"I (F20) have been with my boyfriend (M26) for almost a year and a half now. He's the person I want to spend my life with. However, he's never told me ""I love you.""

Our love languages are very different. I express affection through touch, kisses, and compliments. He, on the other hand, shows his feelings through small gestures, sometimes really small.

I understand why he's hesitant to say those words. He's explained it to me several times. He didn’t experience much love growing up, and the word ""love"" was practically non-existent in his family. He also says he wants to tell me those words in a special place, at a special moment.

But honestly, I’m starting to feel unloved. It's not just about the words; he rarely initiates touch or makes the first move, he never complinents me. I feel like I’m getting the bare minimum. After every visit (we're in a long-distance relationship), I can't help but feel disappointed.

I can't imagine breaking up with him, he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. I know this post might sound like he's a bad person, but he's really not. He's warm and kind person. He accompanied me though my toughest moments and I really want him to be by my side. But I just can't help but feel unhappy with how things are. ",1,2025-01-31 23:22:47,0,1.0,pistachchchio

Found out minutes ago that actually there is at least one other sexual partner that he didn’t disclose - and that he appears to never had an actual STD test. I trusted him and now I can’t stop shaking.

offmychest,1ieqwaa,I'm scared that I might be a little transphobic,"Throwaway account. Will probably delete within the next 24 hours.

I will probably repeat myself quite a vew times since I'm gonna be writing this out as I think it.

NSFW tag because it might be a heavy topic for some people.

I fully respect Trans people and will always support them aslong as their decent human beings, but somehow, I think I might be atleast a little transphobic somehow and that scares me a lot. For some reason when someone I know comes out as transgender, I think of them a bit differently, and I don't mean seeing them as the gender they want to be, because I do see them as that, I have no problem with seeing them as a woman if they want to be a woman or a man if they want to be a man. If a male person I know comes up to me and says ""Hey, I think I'm a woman, and I hope you support me"" Then I have no problem at all with seeing them as that, and I will always try my very best to use the appropriate pronounce and whatever that they want to be used for them. I used to have a friend who is a trans woman, and I completely respected her and would always support her if someone was being transphobic, which sadly happened quite a lot.  
I say that I used to be friends with her because I don't think I can call her a friend anymore, not because something happened or because she is trans, we just took different paths in education and lost contact.  
Kind off weirdly this is also only with online people. With my old trans friend I didn't have this issue and when my brother's friend came out as trans I also didn't feel like this. It's only with people online. For example, someone I follow on Twitter recently fully came out as a trans woman, and while I ofcourse fully support her will try my best to use she/her for her (I asked what her pronounce were and thats what she said, while if I remember right she used to go by him/him/they/them) it somehow made me feel like I have a lump in my throat when reading it. I really don't understand it, this has happened I think 3 times before and only now did I really realize it, and again, it's only with online people. And it's not like it stayes like this. Atleast last time, after like a week I was fully used to it and didn't have the problem when I read that persons messages. I think it might come from simple surprise or shock or whatever but I'm not willing to conclude anything because I am scared that I'm very wrong about myself.  
I luckely life in a very accepting country and was thought while growing up to show everyone kindness and respect, so it's also not like it comes from outside influence. It's unlikely but if I have kids in the future and one of my children comes up to me and sais their transgender, I would do everything to make them feel safe, loved and accepted, if my partner didn't accept, then I'd leave my partner. If my old trans friend came up to me asking for help because maybe she got kicked out for being trans, then I would immediately let her move in atleast for a while or find another way to help her.  
It's really just online people that I have this with and I find that really weird. What if am transphobic somehow, then why do I not feel this way with the trans people I know IRL? Why does the feeling go away after a short while? Is it just shock? Surprise? Needing to adjust? Do I just need to switch it over in my brain and my brain thinks something stupid like ""Hey, this isn't what it used to be, why is it different now?""

I don't want to think of myself as Transphobic because that doesn't feel like the person I am, and I am scared that I am not who I think I am. I myself sometimes, very rarely, but sometimes think like ""What would it be like if I transitiond"" and if it ends up being that I am trans, then would I be a transphobic trans person? Is that even possible?

I'm just scared I guess that I am not who I believe I am. I'm just confused and the fact that it's only with online trans people makes me even more confused.

It's weird.",1,2025-01-31 23:12:42,0,1.0,stupidthoughtshateme
offmychest,1ieqt09,"Single, yet in love for four years.","For four years, whether I’d like to admit it or not, I’ve been in love with the same person since the age of fourteen. 

This person and I used to date in highschool. From ages fourteen to sixteen we dated until we decided to mutually split – I was leaving the country for college, and we were becoming different people as we grew up. I have not heard from him since.

I think of him very often… How he’s doing, if he thinks of me too. I visit profile pages of people we used to go to school with just to see if he’d be in any of the photos too. There are times where I feel like I’m completely over him until I reach the point where I might consider dating again, only for me to feel uncomfortable at the prospect of it. I’ve tried to, truly tried, but he’s always a constant thought in my mind. It’s pathetic because I don’t think I’m in his. Why would I be? 

Foolishly enough he was my first for quite literally everything and so I think because of that, I have a certain attachment to him. I made him a stupid promise before we broke up that I’d wait for him and that when I see him again, maybe we could reconcile. Mind you this was years ago and was said in a less than ideal state. I think maybe, deep down, I’m hoping he misses me too seeing as we never really wanted to split. 

I feel so stupid having any hope for a forgotten relationship from my teenage years. He’s just a boy, or rather a man now, and I’m just an idiot girl for being so into him after all these years. ",1,2025-01-31 23:08:44,0,1.0,pricevatt

now we are broken up for unrelated reasons but the other day I remembered and inspected myself more thoroughly and discovered it was still there and a strange lesion too.  
  
after the breakup ive been a bad way mentally and my dog is being put down tomorrow and im depressed and struggling to operate and whatever. 

I've never been self conscious about my genitals but now im sad and self loathing. Im applying tea tree oil on it starting today since I also saw a strange white marking  while inspecting it today. almost like vitiligo or like an early wart spot. ",1,2025-01-31 23:08:12,2,1.0,Shape_Silent
offmychest,1ieqs1s,I find out that two of my close friends have been backstabbing me,"I feel incredibly betrayed. I have two friends; we’ve known each other for over ten years. I find out that throughout last year both of these friends have been spreading exaggerated gossip about my private life with all of our mutual friends. They keep eyeing my guy friends (in a romantic sense) when they don’t know these friends at all and it’s getting incredibly weird. They get weirdly possessive of their own guy friends when their guy friends reach out to me first lol. One of them even accused me of purposely leaving her out of events when she’s not even in town and/or rejects our invites (and only when these guy friends are present btw!!), saying she feels “betrayed.”

They’re running out of things to say about me since I’ve been lying low but now they’re making up shit. I ran into one of my guy friends on accident during an event. A week later, one of these two girls come find me saying that her mom has been pestering her to ask me if my parents set me up in a marriage contract with the guy friend I randomly bumped into?? Apparently, her mom’s friend saw my guy friend and I chatting and thought he could be my boyfriend but they jumped to the conclusion that it’s a set-up, a marriage contract. wtf? They be making all these weird ass assumptions. I’m whatever about what they think at this point but what really irks me is that they have to spread these weird assumptions like their religion to everyone they know. Their reason for spreading and talking about me behind my back is because they have to “Talk about their emotions. What am I not allowed to talk about my feelings with *my* friends?“

What strong feelings do you have about **my** private life though????

One of them is so desperate for a boyfriend that she has actively started lowering all single women (regardless of how successful, beautiful, happy they are) to worthless because they are single. But at the same time, she looks at my guy friends (that she barely knows btw) like their prey and acts like they have to 100% agree to dating her if she‘s interested, which btw she insists she’s not! She explicitly states that guy-friend A wouldn’t work because he doesn’t care for her parents so he’d abandon their two kids together (wtf) and guy-friend B is just okay but is so unattractive that he has no game for girls and will be single in the long term, no rush (wth).

I’m infuriated and weirded-out. These are people she barely knows!!! She’s not close enough to them to even call them friends.

All of this only happens when a guy is involved! They make fun of others for being desperate but they act worse than that.

My bar for them is incredibly low at this point. I don’t expect them to be “friends” and just leave me alone but they can’t even do that. My non-related friend keeps telling me to keep my cool and don’t blow up at these two but I’m at my wits end here; suggesting I appear to help and slowly distance myself from them.

What is with them?? I swear they weren’t this way before. I’m incredibly disappointed. I know that misogyny is more prevalent than we’d like but I thought better of these two. They’re acting incredibly backwards; some of the ideas they believe in and things they are doing were considered **outdated** when our parents are our age.

offmychest,1ieqhjl,My boyfriend had a psychotic break,"For context we are in a long term but also long distance relationship (we have met up several times but we can’t live together yet because of some circumstances). 
This past week I felt like my boyfriend and I connected on a deeper lever than we ever had before and he seemed to have so much energy and love for everything. I realise now that him not sleep to talk to me instead and him constantly laughing and being hyper probably was some sort of manic episode. Earlier today/last night he crashed and had a psychotic break. 


I had to call the cops in his hometown to find out that he had been found outside, naked and screaming. They had taken him to the ER where he is still now. I managed to get a hold of him after 11 hours of no contact and he seems… mostly fine now. He was really anxious when we talked though and he told me the scary thoughts he was having during his meltdown. 

This is making me question so many things, can I picture myself living like this? I know he deserves empathy and I do feel it but he said some hurtful things during his episode and the image of him being naked outside and acting crazy scares me so so much. I feel so alone right now and confused, this has never happened before. He claims to not have taken any drugs but I don’t know. ",2,2025-01-31 22:55:23,0,1.0,AwakenedAutumn

offmychest,1ieq1ct,how do I help him?," boyfriend and I have been together for a bit over 3 years, and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. He is the kindest human being I have ever met, I love him so much. That is why it hurts me to see him sad and see so much pain in his eyes.

This may be a lengthy back story, but he hasn't had the best upbringing. He came into the U.S illegally with his parents at the age of 3, and lived on the streets of New york for almost a decade. From what he has told me, he said that it was really hard for him, because his father left them and his mother was a young 20 year old that had no idea what to do. At the age of 5, he had to figure out on how to take care of his younger siblings, because her mother was out and about trying to find a new man. He had to protect them, scrounge up enough food for them, even if it meant that he didn't eat for days. Fortunately for his mom and siblings, they were able to find shelter however the owner of the house did not want my boyfriend with them, so he was forced to stay in the streets. He is vague about his experience when I ask him about it and always stares off with tears in his eyes, but he did tell me that older kids and drunk adults would beat him so badly that he would be a bloody mess on the sidewalk gasping for anyone to help, and all people did was step over him, a fucking 6 year old. Although he did meet a nice girl at school that would bring him clothes and food, they became best friends. She was always there for him, she was there during his 9 month coma (long story), during his diagnosis of Retinitis pigmentosa (eye disease that may leave him blind in his 30s), during his heart failures because of poor enviornment. To me it sounded like they were soulmates because they even got engaged at the age of 20 but he sees her as his guardian angel, who has always been there to save his life. 1 month before their wedding she was killed in a hit and run. Him, his fiance and her little sister were playing softball and the ball went into the street and the little sister ran after it without looking and a car was zooming down the street and him and his fiance ran to her little sister, he got there first pushed the sister out of the way and froze out of fear and felt a push and went flying to the side and saw his dead fiance when he turned around. He said that, that moment changed him that it almost broke him and he was so angry with God for not taking him, and for sending someone that he fell in love with to serve as a guardian angel, all her life, she has protected him, in his mind he would have been dead a long time ago, if it wasn't for her. She helped him when he was at his lowest and encouraged him to start his own business which later paid off because he ended up buying a home for his family. In his own words, he owes her his life and now lives his life in a way that it would make her proud.

However, it wasn't like that when it happened over 7 years ago, he was taken over by rage, and vengaence and he didn't know what he would have done if he found the person that killed her. Fortunately, they caught the guy, but the feds came and offered him a proposition, he can use that anger and hatred for criminals and use it working for them. One thing you should know about my bf, he is scary smart, he currently has 3 degrees from MIT, he is good with patterns and math, as well as a god given gift at reading people and their intentions and being able to predict their every move and thought, he also has short sleeper syndrome, in which he only sleeps 2 hrs at most a day, so all this plus his background really caught the eye of a government agency, that and half his family was also massacred by the same criminals they are after in his little village in Mexico when he was 2. Working for them for several years really helped take out all that anger and pain, and once he felt like his work was done, he left the agency.

Then we met, I was intrigued from the first day i met him, he was so shy but charming, very sweet and engaged with me for hours on our first date. But i think what intrigued me was what he didn't obviously portray, the small natural things unique to him, like the way he carries himself, he always looks so relaxed seeming as if he has no care in the world, its weird because without really paying attention to him and just glancing at him you would think that he is just another face in the crowd, but once you actually see him, he sticks out like a sore thumb, its so weird, now that i am constanntly staring at him he seems out of place like he doesn't belong among us, but noone ever seems to ever notice him, even when we are out together and random people approach us,they always approach me or start conversations with me but never seem to notice that he is there. Other intriguing things I found about him was finding out about his visual disability, I was curious how he moved around the city, and was suprised and impressed to find out that he has every part of the city memorized in case he walks during the night, every street, alleyway, turn, etc. Which was funny to see when we went somewhere he has never been to or memorized, it's like seeing a fish flopping on dry land. He was tripping every 5 seconds and running into poles and walls, it was traumatic. He tells me that he has issues with non moving objects, that with people and moving objects that it is much easier to avoid or sense because he uses vibrations, sound to avoid bumping into people. He is so good at this that i did not beleive that he was visually blind because of how confidently he walks around the city.

Our relationship has had its ups and downs but at the end of the day i know that he will always be there for me. For example I think the day fell for him and knew he was the one was when it was only 2 months into our relationshp and I had bad finacail problems, I remember that he came to my apartment one day because i was in shamples and he sat on the floor with me in my apartment and ate ramen noodles as well as slept on the floor with me, without a blanket or anything. I was poor and had no furniture or bed. That one gesture made me fall hard for him, although it was initially a bad night for me, he found a way to get me to talk for hours and laugh and end up with one of the most memorable nights of my life. The next day he had my stuff packed and told me that I would be moving in with him. Now we are three years in living in a nice place in a nice neighborhood, with a good life. The only hiccup I would say that i want to fix/resolve is my family. They do not like him at all, just because who he is and where he comes from. They cannot accept that an illegal from Mexico has accomplished so much without any handouts. For 3 years now my mother has harrassed my bf, calling him a criminal, human trafficker, drug dealer, etc. In their eyes someone like him can't be educated and graduate from MIT, or own a home. They are so convinced that he is using me for a green card and for money, even though he has no intention in becoming a us citizen, and he is like 1000 times wealthier than my entire family, but I can't tell them that. At first he didn't care, he says that he is used to it, but the breaking point for him was when they started insulting his family. They called his family a bunch of illegals, and what do they know of human decency and integrity and respect when they are illegals. He kept his cool, but he doesn't ever want to see them or talk to them for their sake.I don't know should I try to fix that relationship.

But the part I need advice the most is the part in which I hear him cry at 3am, or when i see a whold world of pain in his eyes. He tells me that he doesn't want to burden me, and that if i knew everything than it would emotionally break me in half, and that he will be ok. I just don't know what to do, he is so kind and speaks to everyone with respect because he know that people have more going on in their heads than what they let on, he is great with kids, there has been countless times when i have seen him kneel down to a kids level and have conversations with them, he is just so aware of what people can potentially be going through young or old, but never seems to be concerned about himself. I love him and want to see him happy, what should I do.

Any advice? Sorry for the post being all over the place, i tried to keep it as brief as possible, but still giving a bit of context.

offmychest,1iepyu7,issues affecting my day to day life and i can no longer function how i desire to,"I'm F16 and I am very outgoing when I'm with friends. I can't say I'm able to be myself fully but I mirror my friends' personalities. I guess I am myself a little with them but a lot of me comes from them. If I were to actually outline who I thought I was it would be different than what everyone else thinks. Completely different. I find it really hard to show certain parts of myself. When I study with friends and put on my music I literally move my screen away so they don't see what I listen to because I'm afraid of what they'll think or say even though they probably don't care, won't judge or may be interested. I also am terrified to be perceived as what I don't want to be like stupid and other things. I had a guest come in to school today and I was scared to ask questions because I thought he'd bite my head off, scared to ask for a picture and perhaps some insight to his field of work which I was thinking about. I really hate being like this because I truly end up regretting it. But this happens a lot, I am quite scared to ask questions in a larger setting and I try and perfect them beforehand so I don't sound completely foolish. Then I don't even ask the question which is really annoying because I want to but I can't, my heart starts beating and I get really stressed. I find myself people pleasing a lot and refusing to do simple tasks like returning sauce to the front when my friends and I have gone out to eat. I have fears of everything and I want to be confident and leave my comfort zone but I'm really struggling I can't do it.
I want to talk to someone about this but it can't be my parents, I would love to get a therapist but my parents would never let me and I'm not sure what to do or what's wrong with me.
But one thing I am certain of is that my parents are a very large factor in this, I know that I have to have some form of neurodivergence or issue. I'm from an african household and I believe that I've suffered a lot of trauma as the oldest daughter. because I was beaten a lot and verbally abused. i have problems with relationships and i am sure i am a fearful avoidant  person, my people pleasing and fear of a lot of things comes down to how I was treated by them in my younger years. i base confidence all on the looks i am 100% sure that if i were to lose weight I'd magically be more confident and I genuinely believe it. man I don't know because I attach looks to everything and my mindset is very superficial. yeah. i really want an ed, i used to want to be in a coma or an accident to lose weight or to make my parents feel upset befause then theyd actually care abojt me. my friends all say I'm skinny but the view I have of myself is so distorted I don't know who i am.",2,2025-01-31 22:33:05,0,1.0,PartyReply690

offmychest,1iepdvd,Could my same-sex BFF of 10+ yrs - and current flatmate -be secretly in love with me if she often jokes about marrying me? Or have I just consumed too much BL content? I'm agonizing over this.,"I don't know if I'm at the right place, but the situation is as above. I know it's probably impossible to see the situation clearly from across the Internet, but I've been agitated lately because of the possibility of it. We've been living together for a few months, (both females, 27). We've had these types of jokes about being ""married"" when cooking meals for each other, for example, but I can't shake the feeling that she means it somehow more seriously..?

Right now it is about every to every other week that, during either serious or joking conversations, she casually drops that she would marry me without hesitation, the only problem is that I want a man and his ""belongings"". When we first moved in together, she also added that she, too, longs for a heterosexual relationship, but she omits this part now, I don't know if it's because it's only a joke or not. (Of course I am not heterophobic or anything, I just couldn't fall for another woman, let alone my best friend).

She's always been much more emotional than me and more assertive w. her emotional needs, so I'm also confused whether I'm only uncomfortable because of our personal differences in our needs and in expressing ourselves. For example, the fact that I'm a real introvert with a huge need for space and alone time, whie she would like to be joined at the hip.

Or, about physicality, I remember when we were in high school and she used to ask me to comb her hair, or her slowly touching my shoulder in a very sensual way that made me feel embarrassed. In later years we discussed it and she owed it to being touch-deprived. There were phases in our long and great friendship when I felt like she, even if non-consciously, expected me to be rather a substitution of a boyfriend/romantic partner, but we're through with that too, having talked and worked through very openly about all our hardships together.

I'm really blessed to have her as one of my 2 bff-s in my life. I love the girl very much, as a friend. I don't even know how I'd have gotten through rough patches when she was my second family instead of my family, and I know it's the same for her.

The problem is, I've always struggled to maintain healthy/comfortable boundaries or distance with her. It seems like we always learn about each other, respecting and working along w. each other's needs and fears, but something keeps resurfacing in me that sparks suspicion and discomfort.

A few months ago, for example, I asked her to wake me up if I'm not awake already when she is setting off to work. While I expected her to open my door and tell me to wake up, she came to my bedside and gently pressed, almost caressed my shoulder. I was flabbergasted as I don't like even my closest family doing this to me. The only exceptions are my bf-s, as this signifies romantic intimacy for me. On the other hand, I know that our family is quite stiff and un-touchy, while hers are much more open and touchy.

Could it be this and the differences in our attachment styles that bugs me and that I confuse? I have a bit of an avoidant stlye while she has a bit of an anxious one.

I've dated  throughout the years and had long relationships as well, including a now blown-up engagement, while she's never had any unfortunately.

Before she fell hard for a guy a year ago, I'd been even more suspicious, as I'd never seen her seriously fall for anyone except a short-lived crush once during our 12 years. She's been over the moon for this man, though, however, sadly, it was proved to be one-sided. (So technically this wonderful, phenomenal woman's never even had a kiss or a date in her life).

The topic of her possibly being bisexual/lesbian came up twice in the past, both times confirming she'd given it a thought but coming to the conclusion that she was straight and the reason she wanted more attention, physical touch and time from me than a (our) friendship can handle was because she used to want to and be able to feel every kind of compassion/love through a safe channel which happened to be my person alone. That was years back, though.

Knowing her, if I straight out asked her if she has romantic feelings for me, she'd deny it even if it was true for a tremendous fear of losing our friendship. Of course I am scared of that too, but I'm also a bit scared of losing this cardinal relationship because of her possible romantic feelings surfacing. I'm starting to feel concerned and unsafe by the thought of relying on our friendship while I might be a) causing her suffering b) risking her confessing to me one day and having our friendship crumble.

I'm vulnerable, I need strong allies in my life very much right now and each week I am afraid that I might be feeding emotions in her that I cannot reciprocate; that my joking terms of ""wife"" and ""being married"" land differently for her and that it is slowly making her getting closer and closer to me and it might give her a false hope or at least an illusion (as I repeatedly tell her that I'm straight). I question if I should fully rely on this relationship right now.

I also question if I've been massively overthinking this for YEARS now as I operate very differently from her and because I allow certain levels of intimacy only in romantic relationships that, for her, seem to be ok with me (and with me only).

Thank you for any kind of observation, opinion or support if you've managed to read through it. Sorry for the length.

offmychest,1ienuth,Mental health care system has me wanting to kms.,"At 11 years old I was put in a mental health ward. By 14 I was on 8-10 medications at once. At 19 I went through psychosis for the first time. By 21 I’ve been in 9 different mental hospitals multiple times. I was not violent yet I would be treated as such due to my large stature and inability to socialize. From 13-18 I identified by a different gender and went by a different name. Though I ended up changing that seeing how I was treated in the healthcare system because of this. Not only being misgendered but deadnamed constantly. I’d be laughed at for getting upset over the deadnaming. So i went back to how I was before. I’m not happy but i was not being abused. Until I was. For my psychosis at 19 I was treated as a “grey code”. I was put in my own room since they feared for other patients. I had never been violent before nor had I shown signs of violence. I was in psychosis and so they treated me like a criminal. I’ll never forget how deluded I was I thought all the groups were directed towards me specifically. I told the therapist there this. He acknowledged it but didn’t say much back about it. He stopped telling me when then groups were instead of explaining that it was just delusion. This furthered my delusion. There was more to that hospital. I’ll never forget being an adult and forced into that place. A place where I didn’t feel safe and was consistently pushed further into delusion by other patients and doctors. And you don’t have to believe me, it was purposeful though. 

I was a child when this all started. I can’t help but think that if they hadn’t thrown me in a hospital anytime I’d have an outburst I would be okay. I was a kid. I didn’t have emotional maturity. Outbursts were bound to happen. 

I feel stuck. I don’t have social skills due to missing so much school. Nor do I have the typical education. I constantly have to look for a good doctor. Since the majority just want to sedate you and send you to wards. I want to get better- I don’t want to be drugged.  ",1,2025-01-31 21:03:26,0,1.0,AstronautNecessary95
offmychest,1ienutf,I’m not proud of this and I need to know if I am a bad person.,"I don’t usually ever talk about things like this, especially to strangers and I will probably delete it eventually but….

I’m 21.  And from like age 8-20 I had a problem with stealing. And it was not because I necessarily needed to but I would usually just take candy from stores. And as stupid as sounds, that’s literally the only reason why I did it…because I wanted candy. Only time I took something I actually needed were some batteries and a phone charger but nothing beyond just that.  I also took money from my classmates lockers and I even once almost took someone’s iPod, but I was so afraid that I ended up giving it back the next day. But what’s even worse is the fact that I have taken some of my brother’s birthday/Christmas money that he keeps in a stash. Rough estimate somewhere between $100-200.  And yes I do feel horrible about it all. And I wish I could go back in time and have never done it to begin with. Fast forward to now I have successfully fought off the urge to shoplift because I know how bad it can be for your career if you get caught. I’m currently a full time college student so I don’t work. My dad gives me a certain amount of spending money every week to kind of help me. And I have been putting a bit of it back in my brother’s stash as restitution. And no I haven’t told my brother because we do have a good relationship and he’s one of the closest people to me. I appreciate any advice. I decided to tell my mom pretty much what I told this thread. I didn’t go too deep into detail in terms of listing every single thing I took but I told her enough to know what’s going on. Surprisingly, she didn’t get angry about it. Disappointed, yes. But I know she was glad I told her. She reminded me in her humorous fashion that she “reserves the right to get mad.” So this weekend we plan on going to the bank to get money out of my savings and give it to my brother. Right now, he’s at school in a difference city and won’t be back until Spring break. That’s when I plan on telling him and giving him the money and will offer to buy him lunch afterwards. I do feel better now that my mom knows but the mission isn’t accomplished until my brother knows. Like I said, him and I are fairly close and we rarely fight over anything besides petty stupid stuff, so I don’t know how he will react. Prayers and good luck would be appreciated as well as any additional advice. Feel free to call me pos as well",1,2025-01-31 21:03:26,1,1.0,JuniorPlastic3562

I don’t think you’re screw ups. I don’t know why they say mean things and why the nice ones don’t want to interact with us past formalities. 

I don’t think I’m making any sense. There’s peasants like me who instead of having a good time are just mopey and sad looking about being a peasant and we bring the vibe down.

offmychest,1ienk5z,I accidentally hit a cat last night and I can't stop thinking about it.,"I was on my way home from work last night. I had been driving for maybe an hour and a half because I had to stop at my friends house. My parents invited me out to eat and I declined. I was a minute down the road from my house when a little orange baby ran into the road. I was going about 40 miles per hour (the road is boulevard and the speed limit is 35), and I saw him as he crossed the median into the lane on my left. I slammed my breaks as hard as I could, but I couldn't stop. I hit him. I was in shock and pulled over as soon as I could. I called my boyfriend and then my brother crying  my eyes out. I jumped out of my car and tried to check on the baby. I got close enough to see the blood and to see that he wasn't breathing. I cried even harder. My brother, a friend, and my boyfriend have been constantly checking on me because the guilt is eating me alive. I had so many things to do that day, but I stayed up till 2am crying when I had work at 7am. I ended up calling out and am now sitting at home letting the guilt consume me.

Last night, my friend volunteered to go take a look at him to see if he had a collar, but someone was already there on the phone calling someone so she came back home. I then got the courage to go with her and we went again, but he was still in the road. He was moved further into the road, and we could tell that cars were still hitting him so she grabbed a plastic bag and moved him off to the side of the road so no one would hit him anymore. He didn't have a collar on. We moved him at around 8pm, but I hit him at 6:30pm. I called an emergency vet and just asked what they recommend I do and they told me I could take him myself and they would take care of the body and scan him for a microchip free of charge, but I just can't bring myself to do it. They suggested I call animal control, so we did. We left a message for animal control that night to come get him, but my mom took my sister to school this morning and I asked her if he was there and she told me yes. She told me if he's there by tomorrow morning, she'll help me take his body. I leave for LA in the morning so she said she and my dad will go. It meant the world to me knowing that they don't harbor the same love for animals the way I do, but they would do it to give me a peace of mind.

My boyfriend and I have been talking about getting another cat (he has one already) when I move into his house. He knows I've always wanted an orange cat, but now I don't think I can ever look at one without feeling guilty. I've been on the opposite end of this situation before. When I was around 8 someone hit and killed my dog and it tore me to pieces. Now, I'm 24 and possibly put a family into that position. I hurt an innocent baby, and caused grief to a family. I torture myself by looking at posts of people who lost their cat recently in the area and one of them looked like the one I hit. I hate myself so much. I can't look at my sisters cat without crying and feeling guilty and wishing I did more. If I had stayed at my friends longer, I wouldn't have been there. If I went out to eat, I wouldn't have been there. Thinking of all these possibilities is killing me. I just don't know how to process this.",1,2025-01-31 20:50:57,0,1.0,CountOld113
offmychest,1ienj1h,"Back on the fence after miscarriage, more conflicted than ever","Earlier this month I suffered a miscarriage at home at about 7 weeks. We had seen the heartbeat earlier that day and then the miscarriage happened at home in the middle of the night and the whole ordeal was traumatic. After recovering physically from it, I'm now trying to reassess how I feel.

While I was pregnant the hormones made my already anxious self (GAD, OCD) worse by hyper fixating on all kinds of things relating to my unborn child that I hadn't previously thought about while TTC:

* what if our child is disabled? I know my limitations and that I would be resentful/not be able to handle it 
* what if I can only be OAD and not give them a sibling, is that fair to them, considering me and my husband love our siblings?
* will they be able to make a reasonable living twenty years down the road to be able to survive in this economy? I can help set them up financially for success but I still worry 
* will they be happy? am I just bringing them into the world to suffer?
* what if they're allergic to our dog, who is my first baby?
* is it ethical to bring a child into the state of the world (also am US based so the recent election has been weighing on me)

Among other thoughts and worries.

I wanted to let my hormones recalibrate and my mind settle down to revisit how I felt about these worries. Now that I feel mostly back to my normal self, a lot of these still feel like serious concerns that give me pause.

My husband really wants to be a parent and I know he would be a phenomenal father, and I do want to see that for him, and share that experience together. But it's hard for me not to at least reconsider some of my concerns after having the miscarriage rather than rushing into trying again, because I feel like the panic will just set in again otherwise.

I'm having a very difficult time reconciling my feelings. It took us 6 months to conceive this first pregnancy and during that time I felt a void, and sense of longing with other friends/family being pregnant or seeing others with their children, but I wonder if that was just FOMO vs. my true desire.

I'm a huge animal person and always had a desire for dogs/pets and I know it doesn't compare but I worry because I never previously had a longing to be a parent that my feelings might waver afterwards.

We happen to need to wait on some other medical testing which is giving me some time to sit with my thoughts but just looking to relate or share into the void as I have a hard time discussing this, and my therapist is very pro-kid, and also doesn't always understand my potential desire for OAD with the nuance I'm trying to convey, so sometimes I think that colors her perspective during my sessions with her.

Hey everyone. Sorry about my English. I'm too sad to check out grammar

I have a best friend for almost 10 years. She sometimes act aggressive but I stay silent. (unfortunately I'm a people pleaser who hates herself) we did so many things together, spend too much time. But she always find a reason to pick a fight.

Anyway, few hours ago we confronted. She told me that I was so jealous of her???? Which is I'm definitely not. Told me horrible horrible things that hurt me so bad. I can't even have energy to write. But worst of all is that: you are jealous of my cousins because you can't have any in future.(my only sister is disabled and it's fatal. She wasn't always like that but it happened in her 20's,which is I'm terribly sorry about. My mother got heart problems bc of that.and my ""friend"" knew it all.

offmychest,1ien5gp,I’m Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"I (21M) just watched the movie, and wow I am her. Not impulsive like she is, but the silly and making most out of life mentality.

My girlfriend (23F) is like Joel. She is so content with her life. She doesn’t really have friends. All she does is work. And she doesn’t engage in hobbies a lot. She does play video games and watch gossip girl.

We have been together for 1.5 years. Long distance (only 2 hours) for 8 months. This has been a problem for 6 months. I try not to bring it up since we aren’t together and nothing gets solved over the phone. We see each other weekends or every other weekend.

I’ll just straight up make a list of problems:
- Doesn’t show interest in me, my life, or my interests
- Barely has her own interests, and doesn’t engage in them
- Doesn’t enjoy life, and barely tries when I ask
- Everything feels like it has to be this whole thing we go do with her
- Feels like I’m trying to entertain a wall
- Is always tired (she says she has been depressed for a long time so that is maybe why?). Not a bad thing, but we wake up and eat and she’s already falling asleep. She’s never woken me up before.
- Happiness > money, but she has made dumb financial decisions and that scares me. Talks about how she wants to be rich, but then doesn’t do anything to make it happen. 
- Will never sing or dance, even if I try to grab her arms and dance for her (because anxiety)
- Rarely shares thoughts and opinions. 
- Never gets excited about anything. 
- Doesn’t listen to music (I rly tried to push this on her and now she does have 1 artist she loves). I play and talk about music, and she has not once asked who my favorite artist is. Or ask about anyone I listen to in general.
- Never asks me questions^.
- Doesn’t laugh out loud. (I would kill to hear her laugh)
- Never wrote me a note.
- Has no energy. Never like sits up in bed or tackles me or anything. She is casket ready or something idk. Ok that was rude I’m sorry.
- Like no goofy side

I am not happy with her right now. I was so in love with this girl. She was perfect. My relationship before this one was horrible so I finally knew what love was. As time went on, some things would happen and I never said anything, until about 8 months ago. Ever since, more problems arise just every time we do anything. 
- we go on a cruise she hyped up, she acts bored the whole time
- we go to a party, she is miserable the whole time
- we hang out at home, she has nothing to talk about or any ideas
- we play pickleball, she complains the whole time
- we go to a concert, she stands still and has no thoughts or opinions
- we invite friends over, she doesn’t know how to talk in group settings

We haven’t broken up because she loves and cares so much for me. And I do care a lot for her. And I know I was 100% in so much love for this girl, but it feels it just dwindled getting disappointed over and over again. I want to stay. I want to make it work. But it has been a long time, and I feel I have given it my all and it has not felt reciprocated. But maybe I’m just like Clementine and will always get bored, so I don’t want to ruin it and live regretting it. Wasn’t that the point of the movie? To stay and make it work because that’s what love is?

Also what makes it hard, is she has reasons every time for her complaining or not having fun. And I try to be understanding, but it’s like she’s allergic to enjoying life a little. Also, she is an only child and her mom (who I don’t think was the best mother) raised her by herself. I think that environment is part of what made her who she is. She also just does not have friends or interests so it’s like she has nothing going on in her life. Just work, sleep, and scroll. I hate how it makes me think less of her. In the beginning, just being with her made me want to be a better person. Now I don’t care to put in effort because neither does she. I am drained.

When I clicked play on the movie, I immediately knew shoot, I’m like Clementine and my girlfriend is like Joel. I thought I guess I’ll make my staying or leaving my girlfriend based on this lol (not really but I was curious what the theme was going to be). That movie is a lesson from mistakes humans have made over and over again, so I don’t want to make the same mistake. But I feel like I put so much into my relationship and life and having fun like Clementine, but my boring girlfriend Joel hasn’t or can’t learn to just try to let loose and have fun. Or am I just bored and this is how things will always be? At what point is it okay to give up? They learned not to do that in the movie, so I don’t want to and I haven’t wanted to, but man this sucks.

Also does my relationship only have problems because I am thinking of them? There’s no way because anything we do, I go in and try to have fun, and each time I’m disappointed. 

Ok thank you! Any advice? Please be brutally honest and assume I’m crazy and that all of her reasons are valid and see if that changes anything.",1,2025-01-31 20:33:37,0,1.0,chloe404
offmychest,1iehq5i,I need to move on from this guy and I'm feeling so low right now,"We're both in our 30s. When we met, we clicked. I noticed he was attracted to me. He was in a relationship at the time, so nothing happened. This was a couple years ago. We have a group of friends in common.

Then, last year, he broke up with his then gf. A little after that, we started hanging out more. Then at some point we hooked up. We started hooking up more often. Sex was mindblowing for both of us, he made that very clear. He said he'd never felt such an intense connection with anyone like that.

But still, it wasn't anything serious. He was fresh off a relationship, so of course I understood there was no pressure, though of course I started falling for him. However, since things were casual, we saw other people, I mean we never talked about being exclusive.

Still, for me, he was the only guy I developed feelings for. I though it was mutual, as it seemed when we were alone that he would be a bit more tender each time, he told me he liked me, and made it sound like it was deeper than just f\*\*\* buddies.

Still, no talk of feelings from either side. I'm dead scared of rejection, so I never really made my feelings for him clear, again, because I wanted to give him space considering he had broken up not too long ago.

Our friends didn't really know, it was our secret so to speak, though I think they suspected something. But when we would hang out with them, he would constantly bring up other women he'd been seeing. Now, when it's just the two of us, he kinda made it seem like there weren't really many other women in the picture. But then with friends around, he'd even get boastful, I guess he was saving face, maybe trying to make me feel jealius, who knows.

But yeah, so lately he started hanging out with this other girl from outside the group. And now I think he likes her better than me. The way he talks about her, this past weekend we saw each other and it was like always, but he talked a bit about her. Then we saw our friends and he would. not. shut. up. about. her. Of course our friends were encouraging him, and yeah, I did feel at that point like I was always just a rebound.

And I should've known better, and I'm stupid for having felt otherwise. I should've known, I should've seen it coming.

The thing is, I've forever struggled with my self esteem, so while rationally I know this doesn't say anything about my worth, I feel absolutely crushed right now.

It's probably because I'm plain compared to her (I'm brown eyed and tan skinned, she is white and has green eyes). She's probably more interesting, has more interesting hobbies, a more interesting family. I feel ugly. He probably likes how things between them went on more ""organically"" than just how we started hooking up, which was one time I asked him to hang out and I made the first move. I so wish I was her, that I could be the one to catch his attention like that.

I feel at this age I should not feel like a f\*\*\*ing heartbroken teenager , yet here I am. I feel stupid, I feel ugly, boring. I feel like I'm never enough for guys, I have a history of guys liking me for sex and then nothing else (I don't want to brag, but I have what's considered a nice, hot body, which is what guys often compliment me most on). I feel like I'll forever be that in-between person for guys who often find ""the one"" after spending some time with me.

I know now's the time for reflection, for self-love, for understanding what my needs are, and what I'm doing that this is not the first time this happens.

But still, it hurts, it hurts so much, and I feel dumb for giving so much power to a guy.",2,2025-01-31 16:47:35,0,1.0,6039374838

I relapse, but feel like I've made some major progress recently. I can't remember the last time I watched.

Anyway about 5 months ago I quit my job b/c the environment was toxic and I couldn't take it any longer. Since quitting I've almost completely quit alcohol (I still meet friends for drinks once or twice a month and feel like shit the next day), and porn isn't really a thing for me... honestly my entire sex drive seems to have come to a grinding halt.

For the past month or so my Wife has seem really distanced and spends all her free time on her phone, primarily on tiktok which is fine if she enjoys it. I've given up most social media as well as it's just cheap dopamine to doom scroll. I took an opportunity to look thru her phone, which I regret and feel guilty about, I've always respected that space and never looked thru, which she hasn't had that respect for me. The ""discovery"" of my porn addiction was from her constantly looking thru my phone and reddit history.

What I found was surprising. No solid evidence of a true affair, physical or emotional, or anything like that. But I did find a some search history for ""porn for women"", and her reddit history has a lot of Porn, primarily of women. I'm not one to kink shame and understand that she may look at things that aren't a desire in real life, but I guess I'm most hurt about her taking a very hard no porn stance towards me while she seems to be engaging in porn.

I did start dating her when she was young and she had no experience and didn't really get to try things out, so maybe she's just doing that virtually. I don't know.

In August 2023 my big brothers gf had no home to stay and couldn't stay at my brothers house,so I asked my mom if she can stay and she agreed.I have a king size bed so we slept together.
Both me and my brother are addicted to heroin since I was 13 and he was 15,and at that time I was taking more heroin and other drugs cause I was chilling with addicts that gave me free stuff etc.
When my brothers gf came to stay for 3 weeks and one time we were hooked on coke and made out,I regretted it immediately.After that my brothers gf wanted me to fuck her etc every night,I was uncomfortable with that  and told her that I didn't want too,she was 20 and I was 15 age didn't matter to her and even tho I told her I didn't want her to touch me but  everynight  after I took my drugs and went to sleep,she was trying to fuck me,she was rubbing herself on me and got my hands to touch her even tho I didn't want too she was forcing me and I was too tired,sleepy and also high and I barely could speak and move.I Always was whispering to her to stop and how I don't want to touch her or her to touch me and to stop doing it but everynight for 3 weeks when I was sleeping she was doing it.For three weeks my sleep and night were hell.When I kicked her out,I  told my brother about that one night that we did something with my consent cause I felt bad but I didn't mention that when I slept for three weeks she was raping and sa me in my sleep.
Since then I cannot sleep at night,I have developed cause of her and what she did , heavy Depression and also a bpd 2 years depressive episode and insomnia.
I cannot sleep on my fuckin bed cause I always have flashbacks and nightmares about that 3 weeks.At a point I was sleeping in my closet or slept with my brother,or friends or mom etc.
Now my partner of 7 months,has for sometime since September with me and my parents and everynight we sleep together I felt scared cause I always think she will come for me and do it again.A month ago I couldn't handle it anymore and told  my partner what happened full Story and some of it to my brother.They both were shocked ASF.Now my partner tries to make me feels protected more but still I have a hard time sleeping on my bed still and have really often flashbacks,I am afraid to speak even here cause I feel everyone will make fun of me cause when a girl sa me at 13 and I told some people they said since I'm a guy I have to like it and after that I never tell someone about getting raped and sa.I needed to get all that of my chest cause I can't live like this anymore.",72,2025-01-30 21:16:31,18,0.88,StatementNorth503

offmychest,1iemoyc,My best friend seems to want the worst for me,"We're in our early 20s and have known each other for 5 years. We're neighbors so we see each other a lot, 3-5 days a week. Last week my bf dumped me and she was the first person I told. She called me and asked if I'm okay and I told her I was sad of course but it'll be okay. The first time I met her after the breakup she didn't mention it and didn't seem to care, and it took two hours for her to ask ""so how do you feel now?"" and it kinda felt weird. I expect her to care more since I'm always there for her when she's been hurt by a guy.   
Recently I've noticed she doesn't seem to want the best for me. She's told me so many times ""that's a bad idea"" when I tell her what I'm doing to better myself. I have naturally light brown hair and have been dying it blonde for about two years, but now I'm growing out my natural hair color because I want my hair to be healthy like it was before, it was much thicker and longer. I told her I've stopped using heat on my hair and she said ""that's a bad idea."" I don't know if it's jealousy or sabotage bc she's told me I have her dream hair, and she also uses heat on her hair every day and it's thinner than mine which I know she's insecure about.   
Today I told her I'm quitting caffeine since it makes me more tired and she said it's a bad idea. She drinks energy drinks every day.   
What the fuck is going on even? She shoots me down when I'm trying to be better and it's not like I've ever told her she needs to stop drinking caffeine or using heat on her hair, it's just common sense that those things are probably not good for you.

offmychest,1iemjmk,It feels good in a different way to have a job again,"Spazing out and quitting the previous job. To now working for 2 dollars extra per hour. 

I get to buy all the greasy cheeseburgers again and mouth watering French fries with ranch that will literally excite you're taste buds and make you wanna dive in to the food heaven even more. 

Then you got the smoothies, the doughnuts, the energy drinks that taste sweet but the perfect amount of sweet .

Have you ever had a bacon cheeseburger for breakfast? You should try it, it's like heaven inside ground beef. 

Then you can:

Shop on Amazon

Invest in stocks, bonds, cryptocurrency, mutual funds, treasuries, etc. 

And God bless the homeless because I don't see how they do it. I can't have just only a beer for breakfast. I need meat, cheese, and sour cream. 

Having a job is like entering a secret level in the game of life.

offmychest,1iemhpx,"I am Single Child of Divorced Parents, Please Hear Me Out","Divorce cases have recently increased in  my country (India), however most of these cases only say about the parents who are splitting up but not the permanent scar it leaves to their children. Hence I decided to share insights about my life.

 

My father was from a rich business family while my mother was a village girl who came to city for studying, feel in love and married my father. My father used to go for “business trips” for months and return for certain amount of time. I was born in 2004, my mom found out that my father married another women using a different identity and she was having his child as well.

My father tried to convince my mother to stay with her an give him a second chance and she forgave her, however he didn’t mend his ways hence leading to their separation  in 2006. When my mom came back to her parents and sisters, they didn’t accept me (they were against my mom’s marriage). My grandparents and my mom’s sister wanted my mother to get married again to a guy of their choice but since I was a mere obstacle, my Mausi (Aunt) suggested to give me to an orphanage, she also said in loud voices that if I ever become a good and successful human (I still remember those voices as clear as it was yesterday and it echoes and haunts me often).

My mom came to city (Kolkata) and started working, we had been living in rent ever since from 2009. My mom wanted mutual divorce (on ground of husband’s adultery) and financial assistance for my education till undergraduate degree and a house for living, we consulted few lawyers,

My mom went for an off-court settlement where my father agreed to buy us a house (this was 2011) and pay my school fees.

My father kept ghosting us for months and changed contact numbers and left abroad.

We had absolutely no touch with my father over a decade. Once, my mom had call from another women claiming to be ex-wife of my father (not the one I mentioned above).

 

To most people childhood is the time of their life they want to go back, but for me it is the time I always wish I never have to go through again. Not being able to cherish your childhood days is tough.

 

Fast-Forward to Today,

My life has been a battle every day, I have seen my mother break down and started crying relentlessly to some retro romantic songs and movie scenes, suffering financially where every year our rent increases by 10% and every once in 2 years we have to shift to a smaller house and older landlords typically want more rent than 10%.  We couldn’t afford a house since it requires us a down payment of 30% and we don’t have any capital or savings.

My mom has done everything she can to give me the best life so I shouldn’t upset her at all. Whenever we get a financial crunch (always during our shifting times as we need to cover 2 months advance+ brokerage 1 month + shifting at the same time and increasing rents), I helplessly see my mom crying her heart out which burdens me as well.

I feel extremely stressed about my future, I have the responsibility of buying a house, taking care of my mom and also a little kitten we rescued not so long ago. I am sure that I won’t be able to manage finances if I just work in a regular job and I have to dream big in order to survive, I don’t have any other option. This is my anxiety and motivation at the same time.

I didn’t mention many other things in details, my father had used my mom’s documents to get a loan of 1crore for which I despite being accepted to a top 100 QSrank university however my mom couldn’t co-sign a loan for me hence I had to stay back and even face humiliation from recovery agents (we are still fighting case for this), my father has strong political connections and his brother is an MP. My mom got his contact in 2022 however it was no avail. I also went to through several trauma in my childhood and was prescribed medicines by psychiatrist for that as well however I decided to not continue it. 



P.S- Writing all this did feel like releasing a burden,

I am still a college student and I want advice regarding how do I calm my mental health and can bring success and/or peace in my life.

offmychest,1ieh10y,I'm jealous of my elder brother's looks,"My family has never said a single positive thing about my looks, matter a fact I don't remember anyone saying anything positive about my looks for years. All I get are unsolicited advice from people around me on how to improve my appearance, which I have followed. I've lost weight, cut my hair, changed my fashion, smiled more, act energetic, took care of my skin, yet its crickets, nothing I do changes anything.

My brother doesn't put effort into his appearance, he's always been fit, he's never had acne, his skin is clear & he has good hair. He just wears whatever & barely washes his clothes, his room is a mess with clothes littering the floor. My family & strangers believe he is going to become a model, he is 6'2 with good hair, face, body & a deep voice to boot. He's always gotten attention from girls even though he lives like a slob & has a bad personality.

offmychest,1iem7x5,Starting To Feel Hopeless,"My previous relationship ended very abruptly a little over a year ago, tbh. And for a while now I've been trying to use dating apps to find someone new. For the record, I met my previous girlfriend and the girl before on dating apps. So I'm used to them.

The thing is though, I'm getting so tired of it and I'm starting to feel completely hopeless.

Firstly, just all the swiping. I hate the swiping. I actually remember a time before every dating app was just swiping on some picture and it was a much better time, imo.

More importantly, it feels absolutely awful when I spend my time swiping and then there's absolutely no matches. Aside from making me deeply insecure, it's just so demotivating.

And then the final thing that is just making me want to give up and just stay single forever.

I do a bunch of swiping, I get a match, we talk for a little while, it seems to be going okay and then... silence. No more responses.

And before anyone says it, no I didn't say anything inappropriate or something like that. Like the previous girl I was talking to for a day or two and my last reply was about books and psychology. We both love books and she had an interest in psychology while I studied it in college. She seemed enthusiastic in our replies before too. And then just... nothing.

And this seems to happen over and over and over and over and over again. I haven't counted, but I think this exact thing may have happened to me 100 times by now. And I'm just so freaking tired of it.

And I don't understand it either. I don't think it's anything I said in particular. Every reply was different, none of my replies were in any way sexual or inappropriate, and plenty of them seemed to like talking to me.

I just don't get it. And I'm so tired of it.

Using these dating apps is starting to feel like work. The type of work that you drag yourself to in the morning. Only to find out that, yet again, your shift was given to someone else.

And I have some problems with anxiety, so meeting someone ""out there"" spontaneously is very unlikely. So dating apps are pretty much my only option.

So, yeah, that's it. That's what I wanted to get off my chest.

I really miss having a girlfriend. Someone to come home to. To go on a romantic walk through the city with. To eat dinner across from. To joke with. To cuddle watching a movie, or before going to sleep. I miss all of this stuff a lot. But it feels like it's just not gonna happen again.

Sigh, I feel so dejected.",1,2025-01-31 19:54:55,0,1.0,OneOnOne6211
offmychest,1iem1oh,So me and my guy best friend have been pretty intimate with each other but I'm too afraid to say no to him.,"A bit of background info about me. I have a bf (ldr) that I've been together with since 2023 and this friend i have is someone I met in the middle of 2024. 


 So I became friends with this person during the first 2 weeks of class after a labwork and then there we pretty close, plus, he's in the same circle of friends as me. I really get along with this person alongside with another girl friend. Sometimes my group would separate in subgroups so me and them two were the ones I mostly talked/hangout with. During the first semester, we were just casual friends till we became rlly close. We always go to the store, library, and anywhere tgt. Then, when second semester came by that's when things took a different route, I can't specifically recall but I remember starting to sit next to him since the other friend (who's also in our trio) enrolled late so it was just me and him. It started with holding hands when the classroom gets rlly cold. I thought it was normal since the three of us do this. Then, things progressed with him holding my hand everywhere we go. New thing he'd do was rest his head on my shoulder at times, and yes these were okay with me but I started to hear rumours about my classmates shipping us despite knowing Im already taking. After some period of time, he started touching the back of my neck, wrapping my hair to a ponytail or he'd hug me from the back. My senses were tingling but I thought he's just a clingy person well I mean he is. Continuing the story, he started patting my hair, pinching my cheeks, and him sleeping on my lap in class. Idk why but I just thought of him being nice to me. Then things went that way for a month now. 


He lives close at school so my friends and I stay at his most of the time, aside from convenience to my other friends, It'd also save me time since my home is far away from school. i stay in his room (he lives in a dorm) I sometimes sleep on his bed while he sleeps on the floor whenever I had to be away from home bcs of heavy problems. I have no problem with that and he's been such a great friend for helping me out on that. But after 3 different stays I did, we were both laying in bed just scrolling on social media, he would stretch his arms and put me on a headlock. I find that a bit unusal of him but okay. The evening I slept since it was really late for me to commute back home so I stayed there for the night. There, I offered him to sleep next to me since I felt bad seeing him sleep on the floor with his blanket and after that, everything just went weird for the following weeks. We'd hold hands everywhere and he started to hold my waist when he's hugging me. I started to feel uncomfy but I'm scared that Im only overthinking things. He also started to rest his back on me more and would hold my hand and put it on his cheek. During the event, he held my hand most of the time and rested on my lap. At night, while we were watching some movie on his phone he grabbed my hand and held it tightly. The same thing happened the next day while we were commuting back to his dorm since I had to get something I left there. I decided to nap while he was already sleeping in the side. But before that, I tried to wake and ask him if he'd get lunch since it was almost 11 then he mumbled something and just cuddled with me. Mind you, his head was on my pelvic level but there's a distance. So, what he did was raised himself a bit till his head is at level with my chest. I was sleeping on my left side and so he then wrapped his arms around my waist then put his face on my chest. I just froze and didn't know what to do. I wished i could sleep it off. I felt violated but idk what to do about it. Ik its stupid but my mind just disassociated somewhere to cope with the anxiety its causing me. He kept burying his face on my chest whilst caressing my back so i tried to put my elbow on his forehead to act as a barrier because I felt rlly uncomfortable. I quickly contacted my friend when he went downstairs to get something and I decided to leave early bcs i felt so crappy. 


Now I dont know what to do with this. I clearly need to put up my boundaries but I'm so scared that I'd hurt his feelings. But at the same time I cant sleep thinking about what happened and how I feel ashamed right now since he's the first person to do that to me and also he's my best friend that is aware that I have a bf. So idk why hes doing all of these with me. I'm scared of seeing him this monday. I dont know what to do anymore even after opening this up with my bf. Im so confused about what happened.

I can't get the courage to open up about this to my other friends since I dont wanna ruin his image. Btw I appreciate any opinions I get from you guys and thank you for taking the time to help me out.",1,2025-01-31 19:47:34,2,1.0,Character-Ad-3813

well until I did wake up, opened my newsfeed, saw the recently trending video of musk (you know which one I mean) and immediately thought to myself something along the lines of ""man why can't my boyfriend elon just be normal again"" (again, EUGH).

offmychest,1iellq7,I don't know how to break up with my boyfriend,"
Sorry for formatting - I'm on mobile.


I don't really know how to start - but my boyfriend (27M) and I (21) have been together for just about 7 months now. 


It was great at first but the more time we spend together the less compatible I think we are, but he doesn't see it that way. I didn't know about his substance use habits in the beginning (if I did, I never would have let it get this far), he originally said that he never wanted children either but dating me has changed his mind and he can't imagine children with anyone else but me now. I've been adamant since we got together that i NEVER in my life want to be pregnant and NEVER in my life do i want children. It's 100% off the table. I feel kind of blindsided. He gets upset now that I say no all of the time and asks me to think about it more but I have - extensively. It's always going to be no. 


I think what made me lose all of my feelings for him was earlier this month my period was much later than usual and I was freaking out, to which he brought up that if I ended up being pregnant he wouldn't want me to get an abortion and that we would be great parents. I felt sick and I haven't been able to look at him the same way since. We don't even live together. I'm not trying to be mean but that's FUCKING DELUSIONAL!!!!!! We're both poor 20-somethings who haven't even been together for a year, have NO money, I'm still in school and his career hasn't taken off yet. It's exhausting because everything that involves me is like some fantasy for him. He puts me on this pedestal and it makes me so uncomfortable!!!!


I've come to realize I don't like how he talks about other people, I don't like how reckless he is, and I don't like how he talks to me. 


I'm not trying to say this in a vain, full-of-myself way, but he's very much in love with me and I guess Ive never really felt the same way except for (maybe) the 2-month honeymoon phase in the beginning. 


Id never say it to his face but he's incredibly insecure. He asks me if I still love him every day - I feel like it's impossible to answer honestly like that - I can't spring ""I want to break up"" when I responded told him sure, I still love him 24 hours prior. Because what else am I supposed to say!!!!! ""Actually....no,"" out of the blue?? Every time I try to put some distance between us and maybe broach the subject of our compatibility he shuts down completely and I feel so terrible. He talks about killing himself when things don't ""go his way"" and it makes me worried that he'll do something drastic to himself if I were to leave him. 


I feel like our relationship moved too fast from the get go and now I feel kind of trapped. I don't know what to do. I don't see it improving. It's not that I don't try to love him but I've also never been in a relationship where love took this much effort. I'm very independent - If I'm going to be with someone, they have to be sweeter than my solitude and he isn't. 


Sorry about the word vomit. I'm just at a loss. I feel stuck - I know it has to end and I'll be the bad guy either way but I just don't think I can do this anymore. ",1,2025-01-31 19:29:03,5,1.0,Apprehensive-Fig1509
offmychest,1ielja2,Married to a man that has corn addiction and still obsessed with ex fiance,"So...I feel so ashamed and exhausted.
One year ago, my husband agreed to stop watching corn because it is was affecting really badly our intimacy.
After a year, he admitted that he never stopped! He admitted, because, I said jokingly that I will download our WiFi history, so he got scared.
At first I was sad and thought that it was just normal corn, but later found out that he went to find spicy content also on CAM GIRL SITES (talking to some of them), OF, REDDIT and many other places.
My world came down crushing especially because this last year, he was the one telling me that I was too much all over him and he was the one setting times on when we had intimate times (I know it's crazy!!).
Also, this last year, he has been bashing me so much that I was not ""submissive"" enough as a wife or dress up showing too much. Mind you I am a new mom and go out to only for grocery shopping and If I wear something that is showing too much is a top showing with a little cleavage.
Yesterday, I asked him to be completely honest with me and tell me what he has been hiding. He also told me that he tried to search and look for his ex fiance multiple times to see if she is okay. You will probably ask yourself what is the problem, right?
Well, this man as NEWLY WEDS told me that he will forever be emotionally connected with her  because he still has some feelings for her after lying that he was over her.
A month after giving birth he asked me what would I think if he talked to her again, since he saw her on his Skipe contacts, after a long time. 
Now this...
I feel like I was let down so many times, in the past I forgave him so many times. He said that he will change AGAIN, but I don't think it's true. He wants another chance for us  and our little daughter.
I think I want out from this relationship, but I don't want God to be upset with me!
However, in the last 4 years of our marriage he mostly treated me like sh.t, still thinks about the ex fiance and now I feel like he cheated on me since he was entertaining the CAM GIRLS.

i have literally no meaningful relationships beasides them. i'm just a shell of a person without them. no school no college no uni no job for whole half a year already just nothing. i don't know anything about myself. idk if i'm in a better place mentally than i was a year or two ago, idk what i feel and what i want. i just feel numb most of the time.

i just feel like such a failure i felt like i was on the right track i really felt like i was bullding my life and then just one decision ruined it. i wish i would'nt've done it. i feel like everybody has given up on me. i wish i could be vulnerable with her again but i just can't. i have bothered her so much with my feelings she can't handle them anymore with nothing else being done about them. i want to be honest with her and cry in her arms again just one more time. want to vent without being judged. want to be taken cate of. i am so suicidal rn i just wish somebody would force me into a psych ward so i would die at 39 and not bother anyone with my shit ever again.",1,2025-01-31 19:24:52,0,1.0,mylastdagger
offmychest,1ielcs5,my anger,"since i was really young i remembered having intense intrusive thoughts about stabbing my parents or my friends sometimes also hurting myself and dont get me wrong i have the best most loving parents as well as friends. 


this things amplified as i kinda had a lot of mental problems going on during my mid and late teenage years especially during and right after being stuck in quarantine. during that time i started hitting my computer, walls, myself and was yelling almost everyday. i went and saw a therapist and my anger issues kinda got repressed in a sense that i still had a lot of outbursts just not so frequently. i stopped therapy as i had less time on my hands + i dont think it was helping me w anger management as i realised that during stressful times the anger reoccurs and i didnt get better at managing it. 

i figured out that there has been a reoccurring pattern during exam seasons where i just go insane and every single thing or sound (especially by my mom when she is being loud in the kitchen) bothers me so much to the point where i just wanna start screaming and hitting things. to make it clear i still get angry in other cases just not as much as i used to but when it comes to exam periods my intrusive thoughts are next level. it also probably doesn't help that i can't help myself and have terrible perfectionist tendencies paired w other mental issues. 

in addition i was thinking maybe walks would help my anger but when i get angry at other i only manage to remove myself from the people around me but if i am mad at myself the only thing that helps taiming my anger is to act upon it

ps sorry if its not making sense its my first time posting and i got so fed up w the keyboard that correcting everything again would make me spiral + wanted to post this on mental health but it made more sense to post it here and hear somehow

offmychest,1iedg6q,I don't know how to process this...,"One of my ex colleagues/Facebook friends has been found to be a sex offender (against children). I hate his guts, always found him weird and now I guess we know why. He has had his time in court, been found guilty etc etc etc. 

Well he popped up on my Facebook today (i genuinely forgot he was on there to be honest). So I decided to go for a snoop... as you do... 

Anyway I hate the way he's just going round living his normal life. Going for runs, going on holiday (abroad) and just generally existing without any real consequences. I understand it's innocent until proven guilty etc but a court has found him guilty... and he's still getting off (first class) to freaking Disney Land!!!

offmychest,1iel3w8,Feeling sorry for my dad because I cussed at him," I'm feeling extremely shitty right now as if I failed as a human. I fought with my dad and kept cussing at him really hard and harsh for straight 15 minutes because I was angry at him. He had the most saddest face that I had never seen before. He's literally so much disappointed at me. When I was in the living room, he was hiding himself in the kitchen so that I can't see him. When I went to the kitchen he went back to the living room. He's probably crying and not showing his tears in front of me and this is why he's hiding himself from me. I'm very sad today I shouldn't have done this. I'm really feeling very sorry for him. I wish God to keep him healthy and safe and make him forget what I said to him. I've done this mistake and it's such a nightmare for me and I'm not able to get over it, hope it's me who gets affected due to this and not him and not my entire family because it's all on me. He's in his 60s, when he should be receiving love from us, I cussed and mentally abused him. 

Sorry Dad, I wish you all my good karma gets transferred to you and your bad karma gets transferred to me. Please don't take everything I said deeply and forget about everything that happened today. You're an amazing father and provide my family everything we need. My greed sometimes gets worse and I always endup asking for more when I've already got enough. I can have some dreams but fulfilling those dreams are really on myself and not you and I shouldn't be asking you for stuffs and cuss you when you're not able to provide me. You've spent your entire life for us fulfilling our dreams while sacrificing yours. I shouldn't be asking you more and I wish God helps me not being greedy.

offmychest,1iel2eb,What will the racists do with us non-whites?,"Note: this is written from my perspective as a Brit of Indian heritage, but I imagine I will make sense to many others too.

tl;dr - Racists are wrong and scary and need to be stopped.



You see their rhetoric all the time:

""Britain for the British!""

""We must keep Britain white for the sake of our ancestors""

""We are not the same!""

""Non whites are destroying European culture""

Etc. Etc.


These are pretty chilling sentiments for most people (I hope). However, the sentiments themselves aren't what truly scares me.

What chills me the most is how these people rarely give a clear indication as to how they will ""fix"" the problem. What exactly will they do with people like me?

The only real answer I have seen is that we ""will be offered generous financial incentives in order to return to [our] ancestral homelands"". But I have to ask - would the people making these statements allow an authority they despise to buy them out and forcibly evict them from their home?

This country is my home. It is where I have lived my entire life, and in all likelihood, I'll continue to live here for much of the rest of it. It influences so much of the food I eat, the books I read, the music I enjoy, the films I watch, and the history I am most captivated by. English is the only language I speak. Most importantly, the UK is the place of my friends, family, and most cherished memories. It is inseparable from what makes me ""me"".

Are these people so delusional to think I would be willing to give all that up for money? Or that I'd be happy to be ethnically cleansed to India because the people there happen to look a bit more like me? I have visited India twice. Both times, I was little more than a tourist. I am not at home there. 

How the fuck are these people planning on getting the Indian government to accept us anyway?

Also, what are they to do with mixed race people? The genes of mixed race people are ""polluted"", so if they truly believe the world should consist of a bunch of inward facing countries of genetic purity, surely it goes against their morals to palm mixed race people off to someone else?

(I have to add that, funnily enough, I love my mixed race cousins just as much as my ""full blooded"" ones, much like how I love my white friends just as much as my non-white friends - almost like genes matter vanishingly little when you get to know someone)

Well, guess what - I am not leaving. I will fight for my right to stay in this country, because (shock horror), my brown self has just as much affection for my home as these racists do. In fact, I think I love it more, because I believe our culture and history is strong enough to survive and thrive without the need for genetic purity. I am sure that millions of ethnic minorities across this country feel the same way.

I am disturbed by that thought that the leaders of these racist spaces are aware of some of this. Of course, I think they struggle to grasp that anyone could have a sense of home that is independent of their genes, but I think they are know that many of us will not go down without a fight. They are deluded and morally repugnant, for sure, but not idiots. 

I think they know the likely consequences of their policies, but are just too cowardly to reveal their real plans out of fear that the public would turn away from them out of sheer revulsion. They just dont care that it'll involve camps, suffering, disease, sterilisation, rape and a hell of a lot of murder. They might even relish the thought.

I hope some of you are right in thinking that I'm being doomer and paranoid here, but its far too easy to convince ourselves that a modern holocaust could never happen here. For instance, if you were to ask a person at the turn of the 20th century where the next Jewish pogrom would occur, they most likely would have guessed France, not Germany. Millions of hindus and muslims lived side by side in relative peace until India was partitioned and they all massacred eachother. Many Bosniaks still testify that Yugoslavia was a beautiful mixing pot until it fell apart and all went to shit.

What I am trying to say is that I am getting increasingly more disturbed with the state of this country. We have seen race riots sweep across England this summer. We are seeing Reform on the rise. We now have a fascist reigning just across the pond. I even recently had a lovely chat in a pub with an older gentlemen, who, when I went to the loo, proceeded to tell my white friends that a race war was coming!

I know I shouldn't let the actions of some mentalists keep me up at night. However, we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into complacency. I fear that the riots we saw this summer are the result of a growing movement that needs to be stopped.

I don't quite know how to fight back against this rising tide just yet (any actionable help would be much appreciated!). I just need somewhere to vent my fears.

I am co leading at my work and my co lead not only takes away all the limelight but also shouts at me all while pretending to be sweet. My efforts are ignored, I am just seen as a punching bag exploit. Worst part? Despite acknowledging all of that I am unable to change myself, I fear hurting people (not saying just to look good here). I fear what happened to me I accidentally do it to other people, I know how pathetic if feels I don't want anyone else to feel that way. Basically I am being too good for my own good, I have been robbed of a manager position already just cuz I was seen as a pushover by my competiton.

offmychest,1iefpwb,Just my story.,"This is me, I'm 18 now and will soon be 19. I was born in... [I don't want to say what country because I hate that country, there was a lot of racism towards me and also aggression.] So, I lived there for many years, I was afraid every day that some guy would come up to me and just start bullying me, I'm not very strong physically. I wasn't beaten very often but there were incidents. I was bullied for being white, for being German, when people found out they called me bad names which was a reference to Germany's actions in the 1940s. Also, once I was beaten because I had braces, then I had the first serious injury in my life, a concussion. I myself am not a conflict-prone and rather peaceful person. I had friends, now I rarely communicate with them because of the distance between us, but I can call them good friends. I was often friends with girls, it was easier for me with them. However, I have never had a relationship with a girl. They were not interested in me as a boyfriend, for some I was just a friend, and others rejected me quite rudely. I have a hard time with social interactions, but if someone is close to me, I open up to the person. I have a hobby, this is my ukulele, video games, and I also love music. I am a bit of an introvert and in recent years I have become more isolated and all my social interactions are with my family or people from my German course. I am a German, but I was not born in Germany, it is a long history of my family. But now I am here, in Germany. I am ""Spätaussiedler"", this is a designation for Germans who have returned to their homeland. However, people here don't really accept me, I went to school here and people often spoke badly about me because I was an ""outsider"" here. But I finished school here and now I go to language courses to learn German for my future profession. It's not easy for me to live, I feel uncomfortable and a stranger every day everywhere, both in the previous country and here. I literally won't be able to have a place that I call home. But I'm just trying to exist, I know how valuable life is to me, I love to live. I often go for walks in the forest, it's beautiful and even relaxes me a little. I also study English in my free time, it's my favorite language. I love the US and I want to try to go there one day, at least for a couple of days. Like a child's dream, I realize that it's stupid, but possible Is it so bad to have a dream? This post is like my own little therapy for me, just an attempt to understand myself a little and maybe get support or advice from other people. And in conclusion I want to say one thing, no matter how hard and difficult life may seem, you need to appreciate it, you only have one life and you need to live it so that in old age you don’t regret anything, Even in the darkest times there is at least a little light. Every person carries a light within themselves and we must share the warmth of our fire with others, and not try to see the enemy in everyone. There is no point in dividing people by nation or race, gender or orientation. We are all people, that is the main thing. If suddenly your life is very difficult, then do not be afraid to seek help from loved ones or special people. Even simple social networks can give at least a little help.",2,2025-01-31 15:14:57,0,0.75,ZiLCEiN
offmychest,1iekhow,Just venting about my boring love life,"Not to toot my own horn but I’m a good candidate to be a Mob wife or something. As long as the bills are paid and I get to shop every now and again I’m usually happy. I don’t mind being lead by my partner, if anything I prefer it and I aim to please. Especially if I feel safe and taken care of. I’m picky but not really. I’m not looking for a NBA player or a famous actor or even a billionaire. Just a nice and normal person who adores me and wants nothing from be but to see me happy. Who sees my value.

So the thing is that I’m older (30’s) . I know a few women who are older than me that are “kept”. One with a husband that’s always away and another who always seems to have some man taking her places. They both seem fulfilled and happy in their situations. And they often wonder why I try to work so hard when I could be taken care of. 

The simple answer is I don’t trust men. While I enjoy them and their company and I’ve fallen in love once or twice, a majority of the men I encounter are looking for 50/50 ( I’m sure that’s great for some women but it’s just not for me) or they only act like they want to treat you right for a chance to have sex with you. I know chivalry isn’t dead but it’s looking like a graveyard out here. Literally. The best men ever are dying out. Men my age just don’t seem have it together. 

Now I’m not perfect. I wouldn’t say I fit the typical “sugar baby” mold. I don’t care about bags or clothes. I do think I participate in the same rat race as everyone else to an extent with purpose. I have a teenager (father remarried) but im not looking for a new daddy for him. I’m looking for a daddy for me 🤣. I also care for my sister who is disabled with a neurological disorder. Mostly cooking her meals and keeping the house clean. Getting her to her appointments when she has them. Most would find these things a burden to deal with or a burden to deal with someone who has so many responsibilities. Since I require a little extra planning when it comes to dates and don’t have much room for spontaneity.  

But I can date. I do go out. I just got myself a ticket to see Glorilla and I’m seeing Kendrick Lamar and SZA in the summer. I stopped buying extra seats because I never can keep a date for one reason or any other. A month ago I got tickets to see Kaytranada and I wanted to invite the guy I’ve been seeing because we are both fans of his but I ended up taking my little cousin instead. Which was fun but she didn’t even know who kaytranada is. (Bright side she is a fan now I think.) sometimes I think it would be nice to be invited to a concert for once. Having drinks, dancing, sharing a blunt, just having fun. 

My love languages are gifts and acts of service. I remember once I was so happy because someone got me some curtains and hung them up for me. I got a new bed and they came by to put it together. I really appreciated that. These are things I can do for myself but it makes me feel safe and taken care of when someone else does it for me. It’s nice if someone brings me chocolate covered pretzels (my favorite snack) because it just means they pay attention to me as much as I do for them.

While I am loyal to a fault my relationships are not very successful because i am comfortable with removing myself from situations that make me feel unwanted. Ex: I went on a date with one guy and he was just trying to get me to go back to his house. The whole day was just weird without going into detail but we ended up at a diner and even after I said I just wanted to eat at the restaurant. He tried to order to go and looked at me like I was supposed to go with it. I walked out and called a friend to come pick me up. And I’m glad I did because he comes out yelling and screaming. He said I was poor, fat, stupid, a gold digger, a sex worker, ugly, on section8, you name it he hurled every insult you can think of at me. While I’m just sitting there in silence trying not to cry. Ironically early on in the day he said I looked cute and I smelled good and it was nice I took such good care of myself because that’s important to him. Eventually The restaurant manager came to check on me…twice. I just wanted to get out of there. He tried apologizing a day after but I wasn’t having it, I had to set a good example for my kid and he blamed it on me letting being a mom get in the way of finding love 🙄 Anyway since then I have a situationship to satisfy my needs and he’s great but I need more and he doesn’t. 

But honestly looking around it doesn’t seem possible even if people are still getting married. Are they just married to be married or are they actually healthily in love? Is that possible after the age of 30? 33? 35? Or did I miss the train? A lot of these forums make it seem like since I’m not a Barbie doll or a BBL Queen I don’t really have a shot in hell. I guess if someone was willing to pay for that I might consider it but I just don’t see the value in that for me (I would rather go on vacation where no one will see me anyway). I’m attractive, attentive, smart, funny, a go getter, a lover, I’m a great hostess and enjoy making other people happy. I’m the kind of person who would give my last because I’m already so blessed I know I won’t have a chance to miss it. All in all I just want someone as serious about me as I am about them and I would have eyes for them and no one else. Not interested in hopping from one rich guy to the next. Honestly I’d I could describe myself I would probably be Fran Fine from The Nanny and I’m looking for my Maxwell Sheffield. I’m patient and love a slow burn just like any other romantic.

offmychest,1iekdvm,i realised i like it when guys treat me like trash,"17f 
as the title suggests, for some reason i like it when guys treat me like trash. this occurs especially when i have a crush on a guy - get butterflies when they insult me, rude to me, or even when they dont use basic manners when interacting with me.  i like it even more when they decide to do it on purpose and its not in their true nature to be an asshole. one time this guy was teaching me swear words in his native language and even when they werent really for me i still got butterflies 
i also noticed i like it when a guy 'orders' me around. like another time another guy decided to be overly confident and firm and he was telling me to do stuff and not in his usualy gentle voice and i liked that???
when theyre mad at me i guess i get a bit scared but at the same time kind of hoping that they would insult me a bit. i think its kind of sick to feel that way because i should put into considerations their feelings and not use their emotions for my own amusement or something. 

this only started when i was 16 maybe so im guessing the media implanted these into my brain. my friends also tells me about stuff like this and usually theyre related to sexology. i grew up christian so was natually sheltered and avoided those kinds of things. 

im also not sure what all these says about me and scared to do research in case it corrupts my mind or something idk. anyways its quite embarrassing so ive never told anyone abt this before but i still wanted to tell someone so thus im here. thanks for reading!

offmychest,1ief5my,Depressed Partner,"My SO of 6.5 years has been going through a really bad bout of depression and anxiety over the last couple of years, I'll admit at the start I definitely wasn't supportive or helpful in the slightest and more than likely made the situation worse.


To add fuel to the fire our relationship has been tenuous at best for a long time due to a lot of bad behaviour on both sides, on mine side I cheated in the first 18 months, I organised to meet up with an escort and went to the meetup getting there and then turing around and not going through with it. This is no justification, at the time I was in an incredibly bad spot and genuinely wanted nothing good in my life & thought that it would get her to leave me. I have also been incredibly unreliable for a long time in our relationship, we need to be somewhere, well get there maybe 1hr late. She needs me home at a specific time, not a chance. I have been working on this a lot. ADHD Time blindness is not helpful but I'm putting in the work to make it a thing of the past & have been improving significantly for the last couple of years. We are not on time to almost every event. I'm still often between 10-30 minutes late when she needs me home or somewhere at a specific time though.    


On her side it was emotional manipulation, getting me to open up about my feeling and then either completely ignoring them, using them at a later date to get me to do things, or get upset that I had an emotional response to something and having to comfort her about me having emotions & that I need to make sure she is always happy, this had gotten to the point that I was just emotionless around her and that infuriated & upset her because ""why are you shutting me out & pushing me away"" & a complete lack of physical intimacy, since we past the 1 year mark (well before I planned to sleep with an escort & didn't do it) I'm not just talking about sex, in every aspect the is no intimacy, there is the occasional kiss & hug(maybe 4 a week at most) but nothing else. No compliments, no cuddles on the sofa or anything like that.   


We have been to couples therapy which helped her learn to be much less emotionally manipulative but she still has a long way to go & it helped us move past my transgression & improve me being in time to things.  

I have seen a psychologist  to help with my issues & have made large strides to become a better person.   

She is also seeing a psychologist and that is helping massively.  


Over the last few months she has been getting more depressed & anxious. I've done the best that I can to support her, be there & help as much as I can, too which she has said that I've been doing amazing. We saw her Dr together to get her on some anti depression & anxiety meds which she has been taking.  Over that last few weeks though we have been in & out of the Dr office and the emergency department at the hospital as she has turned suicidal & I've made sure not to leave her alone, to comfort with soft words & support but tonight she hit me with this line ""I don't know how to leave so I'd rather just kill myself"" & It just hit me so god damn hard.  


I did my best to support her through the conversation and let her know again that I am deeply sorry for all the pain I caused and that I will continue to work towards being unrecognisable to my old self & if she wants to leave that is ok, I will still be here to support her and take care of her.

So I’m 19, I’m Non-binary, and Gay (I Like Men, as a biological male) I love men a lot and having sex with them is great, but the current problem I have is that I sometimes wonder if I even feel Romantic Feelings towards them. For example my last three partners I really didn’t feel all that much for them except one. He was my first true boyfriend and I loved him (I think) because when me and him broke up (I ended it) I cried pretty hard, I felt I had been leading him on because I didn’t want to be with him anymore, he was kind of an asshole sometimes and would sometimes just act like I didn’t exist and treat me like I was an asshole when he gave me shit and I’d give it back, so when I left his house for the last time I cried the entire way home feeling like such an asshole. 
The boyfriend after was younger than me (16) and I was 17 still. It was great with him at first, then he started manipulating me to give him all my attention, feel bad for him over small things, and even used his eating disorder against me to make me do things for him (or he wouldn’t eat). I was very depressed at that point and nearly broke my sobriety streak of like 5 years at the point of being Self Harm free. I was numb and would be angry anytime he started texting me. There would be nights I would cry to sleep because I felt trapped and I couldn’t leave, so at some point I told him to fuck off and don’t talk to me, I even spread rumors about him (which were confirmed to be true) because I felt such distaste for him. Then 2024 rolls around and I started dating this guy who was pretty cute but also pretty clingy, which I’m not a fan of, he did similar things as the last one. He was very touchy, and to be fair he wasn’t the only one. But we hadn’t even dated for a month and he cheated on me, made me the asshole, because I didn’t have sex with him fast enough. When I found out I felt nothing at first then I just felt anger, and when I met up with him to get my things from him I wanted to punch him. I didn’t feel like he broke my trust or anything like that, he just was an asshole, who I’m not even sure if really liked all that much, I now despised him. Well a few months later I got back with BF #2, now 18 and I 19. I thought he had changed and I fell for him all over again, I forgot how cute he could be. Well eventually he started back up with the manipulation, talking about his SH thoughts constantly, and I will help anyone with those but all the help I tried to give was unheard and he never did anything about it, which is why I feel it was him trying to get attention from me, he’ll sometimes he’d just spam the word  “OW” in text when he hurt himself because he wanted a reaction from me, well once me and him had sex I feel like that attention stuff was dialed up to 11 and it was becoming hard to stand. Well through out the last couple of months of our rehashed relationship I started to just not feel anything but annoyance most often than not when it came to him specifically when I wasn’t around him but when I was with him in person I still felt the feelings of love, but eventually it even started in our meetups I’d just feel numb towards him. So as of a couple weeks ago I broke up with him, I tried leaving on good terms and even confessed what I’d done in the past to try and show I didn’t wanna break his heart again, but instead of focusing on the growth I’ve had, he decided that he was gonna try and guilt trip me from the past mistakes and make me feel bad again for leaving. So I now I don’t know anymore, cuz I want a relationship but I feel like I can’t love anyone, because I’m attracted to men but there’s just time where I feel like I don’t have romantic feelings with the people I loved/love and I feel like I could be aromantic, but similarly I couldn’t be because I’ve loved people before. And isn’t ARO combined with Asexuality (Aro/Ace) because I’ve never heard of someone who’s just Aro idk I’m just rambling but point being idk what to think


TLDR; I think I may be Aromantic because I have numb feelings towards my ex partners during and out of our relationships.

offmychest,1ide3i6,Surprised by how traumatic an ultrasound felt today as someone who won't have children,"I am 52 and don't have my own children. Short story is it never happened due to some different circumstances. I've accepted it in a lot of ways or at least some of the time...and then sometimes it is still very hard. 

I had an ultrasound today to check out the heath of my uterus due to some health problems I've been having. It didn't even occur to me when I went in that this is the procedure pregnant women have. 

As the tech was rubbing the gel on my belly I suddenly figured it out. 

I had dreamed of a girl. 

As I lay there with this stranger checking the screen, I thought about that girl. All the things I'd tell her. The way I'd look out for her. The jokes we might make. 

But she'll never be. 

I had no idea today would be so hard. It never even occurred to me how traumatic this would be. ",912,2025-01-30 05:12:22,28,0.98,Quiet_Lunch_1300

The words that you speak -that I deserve air and to stand up for myself- reveal itself as a lie when you crush my neck harder the more I fight for myself. I realize suffocating is the only card in my future. How lucky am I to be granted the opportunity to choose how I die?

When I stop struggling and let you keep your foot on my neck, I can taste the air. It’s not enough but there’s a flicker of hope that maybe I can eventually fool myself into believing what you’re saying and believing another outcome is possible. I can close my eyes and dream myself a better life.

So I’m better off not fighting- letting you keep your foot on my neck. Because at least I can taste a little air and your words feel like you care about me. That I’m worth something.

offmychest,1idn1wd,"I stayed with my boyfriend after he cheated on me. 5 years later, life feels like it’s in grayscale.","He cried, he said it was the biggest mistake of his life. I downplayed the severity of his betrayal. 

He was adamant there was no physical aspect. I found tinder on his phone. I saw messages he sent to women. We had been seeing each other 1.5 years at that point. Early on we had discussions about exclusivity - and he said that I wanted to be exclusive sooner than he did. Well if he didn’t want to be exclusive then he should have told me, instead of leading me to believe that we were. He was hiding things from me- if he thought he was doing nothing wrong, why didn’t you give me the full truth? 

Shortly after I found out, I decided to make it work. I was obsessed with him. I excused his behavior because he had a tough childhood, and previous relationship trauma. Covid happened and we were living together, staying together was the easy thing to do. We got a dog, and our lives became more enmeshed than ever. On the outside, we look like a cute couple and share a dog baby. I feel comfortable with him, I do feel safe in some ways. We’ve made so many beautiful memories over the years and I’ve tried my best to forget the bumpy beginning we had. I’ve repressed these feelings of betrayal deeper and deeper into my mind. 

But I can’t say I trust him. Over 5 years resentment built up. I have lingering doubts in my mind. If he got down on one knee and proposed, I would feel uneasy.. what if it happens again? Divorce is expensive.

Why don’t I just leave? Idk, it would be so difficult to peel myself away. It feels like our lives were put in a blender and it would be impossible to separate the pieces that were me or him. He’s attractive but I find myself unable to feel passionate about him .. I don’t feel like doing romantic gestures. Romance is what fuels my sexuality, and I feel little sexual desire towards him anymore. 

I feel like I’m in limbo and my life is in grayscale.. he has been my constant these last few years, but at the back of my mind, I wonder if this is not the love of my life. I’ve always been a romantic and this is not the relationship I imagined for myself. He says it was the biggest mistake of his life and he couldn’t imagine doing it again. He’s not the same person he was 5 years ago.

Unfortunately, I’m not the same person either. ",151,2025-01-30 14:34:17,49,0.94,Zesty_Guava92
offmychest,1iej2w4,My Fiancé Told Me “I’m Milking It” After Having My Wisdom Teeth Out & Is Being Mean,"I (23F) have been with my fiancé since we were in high school, he is the only person I have ever been with. He has never been the overly affectionate doting type for a bit of background. For context, Last Friday, I had all four wisdom teeth taken (2 were impacted) and was a bit a nervous wreck for the whole thing. I do not like the dentist and so I was hoping to lean on him during this time. He took off work that Friday and the Monday after to be with me, but I was pretty much on my own Day 2. I will admit, I was a bit needy with asking for waters, pain medication, and attention but I was on multiple drugs and in quite a bit of pain. He was decently attentive the first day, but after that spent most of his time in the living room playing video games while I was alone in the bedroom. He blew up on me Sunday after he ordered Chik-fila for himself and asked if I could see if his sandwich looked weird. I had a bit of an attitude asking him if he seriously was making me look at his sandwich because at that point I have been able to eat nothing but gatorade and protein shakes, and so I felt like he was almost rubbing it in my face (he most likely wasn’t but again, on multiple drugs and in pain) well after that he blew up on me saying he’s tired of being treated like this and stayed in the living room the rest of the night. Throughout these days he has just been not the nicest. I have to have my head elevated per the doctor when I sleep at night, so I keep the mattress we have elevated which he has thrown fits about that it’s not comfortable for him. The house is a bit of a wreck right now, and he has continuously thrown in my face that I haven’t cleaned the house or done anything and need to stop milking it. We are both nurses, and I took this week off to recover. He is mad at me that “he has to do everything” yet the house looks the same aside from him doing some dishes. He has taken off more time from work to play new video games he was excited about. Most recently, I have to go back to the doctor because I am having some post-operative complications and when I told him about it and that I was nervous, he replied “hopefully you find answers” and then told me he was trying to take more call at the hospital this weekend.

offmychest,1iej117,I'm reaching my limit and I don't wanna,"I'm doing too much. 

Since my dad died in 2022, I've gone through so much I can't even fully explain. He left us with a bunch of debt that ended up ruining the family. We tried to keep his business afloat, but that was a mistake. 

I ended up having to job search in 2024 to be able to afford to feed my mom and brother, and spent almost all year struggling to. I ended up finding one, but I got fired because they found out I take anti depressants, and before I even started. 

Now I do have a job, and I don't hate it, but it is a VERY stressful job. I'm autistic and was diagnosed with ADHD as a DLC in 2022 (?) so I know some stuff is harder for me than other people, especially with being hypersensitive and dysregulated af. I struggled a lot to get used to the job, but as I am trying to survive in this new environment, I also don't wanna leave behind what I love. I love making music and I'm using ALL my free time to do that. I have two gigs for the next two weeks that I'm preparing with fellow artists and it's eating me up. And I'm not gonna talk about my moving situation, because I've been trying to switch houses since October and it's not going anywhere, so I'm perpetually stressed about that as well.

I am happy, that's the thing. I have a job that pays well, I have a good relationship with my family, friends who love and support me... the meds help. But I've started having side effects from stress already. My palms break out in red dots and peel off, I'm having to catch myself clenching my jaw or chewing air. I have no idea how to cope and I don't want people to be worried about me, because I'm the one choosing to put so much on my plate. But I'm scared to end up like all the other adults who threw away their passions and dreams to just make a living, and thought it was a good compromise. I thought so and yet, here I am.

I get good feedback about my work and my music and that makes me feel even more pressure. I don't even know how to properly do my taxes and even if I did, I end up being such a mess about it. I feel like I'm too old to ask, having spent the first half of my 20s studying and being so depressed I wanted to die. I know I just need to catch up, but what does that even mean? I'm neglecting a lot of basic stuff like cooking and washing and cleaning, because I just can't, I just have to cram all my chores onto my free day, so I end up with absolutely no rest. Last night I spent so much time worrying about not clenching my jaw that I barely slept 5 hours.

  
I just wanted to complain to someone, but I don't wanna talk it with people in my life. I get advice that goes nowhere, like ""go see the odontologist, btw there's no free way to do that and it's very expensive"", and yeah, I earn 3 times the minimum wage, but min wage here doesn't even pay for a 1 room apartment and I have to feed 3 people.

offmychest,1ieik72,a very weird relationship with my bestfriend,"so I(19M) have a girl bestfriend (19F), ABC. So we are both in uni and I thought she looked cute since the day I saw her. But I didn't make most of it since there are reasons for which we cannot date and it was obvious since day 1. But we got to know each other as friends and she started getting really close. It was very comfortable and natural talking to her. I didn't have to be not myself. It was really fun until a guy started liking her and I realised how much I liked her. I started writing a journal and recorded everytime I got sad or jealous or happy. It was really depressing some days and really happy the other days. The guy (XYZ) slowly started getting into her life more and it made me even more sad. But due to her past experiences and her not really feeling it with him, that stopped. There is a lot that happened but if I start talking about that then this will be a long ass post. Then we started getting even closer, she always used to tell me about her day and yap a lot since she was comfortable with me, I used to help her whenever and however I can and go out of my way to meet her and stuff. I have never hugged anyone before but it was her who started hugging me ( even before the XYZ incident ). So fast forward to New Year's and after all the stuff at uni we decided to go to the football field and chill. It was not just the two of us but our friend group. Slowly people started to leave and it was just 4 people left. Me her and 2 friends. I was sitting on the field and she leaned on me. One other friend laid on my lap and she also did. Then as we were talking I started resting on her cheeks. And she turned and rubbing her nose with mine ( I will say why this part is important ). Then after a while everyone left and life went back to normal. We proceeded to go on with our days as it was. The most time we spend together is in the library cause it has air conditioning. So we just go there and study for sometime and then just chill afterwards. So around 2-2.5 weeks back things slowly started to change. We started getting closer and the cheek resting thing became quite normal which wasn't the case before. But she started getting really sad and I started getting sus. I started thinking about it and exactly a week ago last Friday after being in the library as we were leaving, I said I would drop her off at hostel as that was usual. On our way she hugged me and started crying. So I said ""should I stop hanging out with you"" cause she has told me that whenever her friends catch feelings for her she just distances herself. And she started punching me funnily and said we both are so stupid and asked me what we should do. But she had dance practice so even though it was very emotional and we hugged we left. She kissed me on the cheeks and forehead and I did so back too. And I thought that would be the last day we would be together and wrote up a letter telling how I feel and got it ready. I told her I would like to talk in person just one last time. Her practice ends late at night after our curfew, but I decided to jump hostel and hang out. Oh my god it was beautiful, I got to talk whatever I had felt for the last 4 to 5 months and be free to be myself and she was also like ""I was in denial for a long time, I never let this happen but with you I don't know what happened"". She wanted it to be really platonic but since New Year ( the incident I told before ) she has been confused and sad. She also knows we cannot date cause both of us don't like casual dating and this can't be made serious cause of reasons. We talked until very late and I got back in hostel. We decided to end things the next time we get to sit and talk like that. But due to having opposite time slots for classes and her having dance practices till late night we still have not gotten a chance to end it. So we pretty much are dating without dating cause we say I love you and say ""kiss"" ( might sound weird but in our language pretty common ) and like updating about our days a lot more, sneakily holding hands and very small levels of flirting. But we both know it isnt going anywhere and we have decided to break it off tomorrow. But I wouldn't be here if things stopped just there. For context I have never dated anyone, hugged anyone, been never close to anyone this much or kiss anyone bla bla bla. So in this 1 week where we unofficially are in a weird thing, we hung out alone 3 days and everytime it's been getting more intense. She told me she won't kiss me properly cause she doesn't wanna take away my first kiss as she feels guilty for doing this and wants my first kiss to be special. But other than that. I kiss her a lot, like it started off slow, but kissing has been pretty intense. Like neck kissing, chest kissing, then like she moans a little and has started humping. She feels really guilty and has to hold back a lot cause she feels like wanting to kiss me properly.


Now my dilemma, as a person who has never dated and as someone who is new to all this and as she is feeling guilty I feel bad. Am I doing something wrong. Am I a bad person. I feel like from an outsider POV this all looks bad. I feel empty cause after tomorrow I have no one to yap to or no one to talk to or hang out with all the time because even before this weird thingy we used to hang out a lot platonically. I do not know what to feel, are we doing anything wrong. We can't make it serious cause of religion and stuff. I don't want to let go but there is no choice. I would like advice and would like to know if this is common.",1,2025-01-31 17:23:07,0,1.0,throwitoutafteruse01

Many years ago, I was dealing with anorexia. I would have starved myself to death had a doctor not put me on anti-anxiety medications that caused me to gain A LOT of weight. 

However, now years of trauma and disability have increased that weight to an unhealthy level. Did you know that most dietitians and clinics will not help people with a history of eating disorder lose weight? They refuse to see you. It's too much of a risk to put someone like me on a meal plan.

offmychest,1ie98r1,Sex is always slightly traumatic,"I think this will be more a vent post. I feel it could be helpful for me to talk about this.

Massive readers discretion by the way, this is just oversharing but I need some expression at the moment, here you go. It involves talks of sexuality at a young age and definitely some unsavory stuff. 

So, I don't really know where to start. Today I was looking through some comics and I found not quite a dedicated sex comic, but just a sex scene from a comic that was definitely explicit. A lot of the time when I see sex, there's a little feeling thats akin to a ""loss of innocence"" feeling. And this has been consistent for a very long time. Just always this loss of innocence feeling. I started masturbating pretty early and began to become interested in sex from there. In my situation that didn't go far, thank god. But for some reason I had a sense there was more to sex, so that meant I began to become interested in pornography at an early age. By this time I'm like 10.

So, in my preteens I watch porn and realize how sex works and absorb the idealization of sex. From shows I watched around that time and earlier, I was plagued by the social position of sex and that lead to a lot of sexual baggage forming when I was young. By my early teens, the fact that I was a virgin fed a big insecurity. This was at the same time where I would go on internet chat rooms specifically meant for sexting and I would just up the age. I usually went on these chatrooms to feel attention and this essentially leaves me in a spot where, although I hadn't had any physical contact with anyone, I was harmed by sexual abuse. Around 15, I had sex for the first time. More sexual baggage, more hookups, more emotional baggage, paying for sex, now I'm here 5 years later. Masturbation is interesting. From what I've found, masturbation feeds not only a desire for physical intimacy, but emotional intimacy as well. And by physical intimacy, I don't really mean sex at all. I mean hugs, non-sexual touch of pretty much all kinds. I'm very physically affectionate and I absolutely love receiving it. But the feeling of intimacy you receive when someone, who genuinely cares for you and you genuinely care for them, is comfortable being naked around you, and is comfortable with, and wants to have sex with you is definitely in that camp as well. Sex and masturbation is what I feel is the only reliable way to achieve those needs on a regular basis. It's not fulfilling, it works in very short term. 

That loss of innocence still prevails. Seeing depictions of sex or porn is like at times like seeing two people have sex right in front of you, and you don't want to watch them. Like I'm physically there, watching it. I feel the vibrations, its too real. I still feel that vulnerability like its the first time and the inner melancholy shows itself. This also presents itself when having sex as well. On a related note, I miss intimacy. Just close, trusting, full intimacy.

I've tossed around the idea of seeing a sex therapist to address these issues. I'm already seeing a therapist and theres definitely an ethical concern with seeing two therapists at the same time, so I've been holding off on it. This is a big topic in my life. If you've read this far, thank you. This likely wasn't an easy read and I appreciate you still.",5,2025-01-31 08:06:24,1,0.86,Oh-kambersan

offmychest,1ieh7o3,"My friend just told me they wanted to ""off"" themselves and I don't know what to do.","Hi, for this you can call me Raziel, for a little backstory also sorry of all the miss spellings I'm cant spell, this all happened about 20 minutes ago mind you I'm 14 years old and my friend I think is 15 she has told me in the past that she was 'admitted' but she doesn't feel that way any more and that she is medicated. So Today at 9:15, I walk into class and I placed my bag down at my assigned seat now the thing is about this class is that if you are one of the good kids you can sit in any seat you want but you can't (normally) bring your bag with you. And my friend (I'ma call them Haniel,) Haniel, looks at me in this sombre cat kinda way almost like puppy eyes and the seat infornt of her was emty 'cause our other friend had been absent for the last few days. So I was like ""damn I feel bad for Haniel, ill go check up on her"" So I walk over to her from my desk in the corner and she sits one desk back from the first row next to the wall and door and I sit my self on the desk part of the desk and put my feet on the chair so I'm facing her. 

So I'm sitting on this desk and Haniel starts staring at me, not saying a word. Then I say ""Where's our other friend she hasn't been here for a while"" and she just say to me

 ""Raziel, I'm going to k1ll myself"" 

And then she just stares at me in this blank ass stare and I don't know what to say or do but like I know I have to say something so I go ""No, that's a perminite consequences to a temporary problem""

and she just says back to me ""Raziel, shut the hell up, I've heard that from everyone"" and then she says maybe ""Im going to talk to the school counselor"" and y'all know on the internet how untrust worthy thoees counselors are so ima save you the part where I tell her to keep it as undetailed as possible and Haniel goes ""I know I can't tell the counselier I don't want to get admitted agina"" and the thing is and we go backend forth with like ""Don't do it"" and ""Im going to do it"" and I =m just si scared and this wouldn't be the first time I k=have failed to save a friend and I don't want to fail again so I'm asking for help.

  
What do I do? Who do I go to? do I respect the fact she only wants me to know? What do I say? I cant fail again. Please help me.",1,2025-01-31 16:24:52,1,1.0,Zepiyn

offmychest,1ie9n8f,I wish someone wanted me,"I know everyone will skip this one just by the title, and I can’t blame anyone. Nobody wants to ready depressing shit. It’s just that I am on the verge of having a panic attack that I can’t shake off and I don’t have anyone to talk to. Just need to… get it off my chest.

I am getting flashbacks of all the times my parents made me feel unwanted. How they would ignore what I said, tell me to shut up. How they would make me get up and leave the couch I was sitting on, because they didn’t want me near my brother. 

When I met my ex, I finally felt like someone wanted me around them. But it was short lived. There were short periods of time where there was a massive amount of affection, big gestures, and then… nothing. I had to figure out how to deal with my mental health issues all by myself in a different country. He just wouldn’t want to talk to me for days and then had to absolutely talk to me bo matter what. I was a super hard wrung out bath mat. I had nowhere to go, nobody to talk to, and no idea what it felt like to be in a healthy loving relationship. So I stayed. And I became more and more numb. I couldn’t feel anything. I was working myself to death. I stopped talking to people. Just worked. Ended my relationship. Worked harder. It became hard to sleep. Couldn’t sleep for more than 2-3 hours a day. So I worked 20 hours a day. 

I didn’t have anyone. I was at my wits end. The lack of sleep was getting to me. I would contemplate ending things, go on the roof. Nobody would even know if I was gone. But I couldn’t do it. Because what if it’s worse on the other side? Chickening out is not a great way to solve problems. They will persist. If I am not wanted by people in this world, what’s the guarantee that I wont suffer in some other way in the other world. The unknown wont solve what I’m going through.

I fought for myself. I drove myself to an ER. They helped me. Gave me meds, set up appointments with other mental health providers. I got diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD etc.
So tonight when I am getting a panic attack, I can pop a pill. It’s nothing like a warm and snuggly hug, but it reduces the emotional pain.

I am still unwanted in this world, but I continue to fight. Maybe this is karma? Penance for some horrible deeds from a different life? Or penance for misdeeds by an ancestor? Who knows. Today, I’ll let myself cry. Tomorrow I have to be brave and face the world alone again. ",4,2025-01-31 08:36:39,5,1.0,chocoPhobic
offmychest,1ieatql,I am unhealthily obsessed with my boyfriend's ex,"My (20F) bf's (22M) ex has always been a sore spot for me. We have been dating for 6 months. They dated for almost 4 years and prior to my current relationship I was a virgin with no experience.

Honestly, ""obsessed"" is the lightest way of putting it. I've gone through all of his discord DM's looking for any mention of her, i've got through his messages WITH her, stalked her instagram, have tried to guess her passwords, found numerous of her other social medias (pinterest, facebook, spotify). I've searched for all of her immediate family, know what their house looks like etc. I even know where she currently lives, though through no digging of my own.

In the beginning of my relationship my bf would mention her frequently - mentioning details I never sought out. Telling me she's a squirter, occassional random 'strange' quirks, and other sexual tidbits. He would make subtle comparisons, telling me he was ""so glad"" I didn't live in a certain area, only for me to find out that's where she lived. So many small moments like those. This honestly fucked me up and fueled a fire that I didn't even know existed prior to these discussions. Suddenly she occupied a very large space of my brain.

It certainly doesn't help that 5 or so months before we got together - nearly a year after their breakup - he was messaging friends about how he wasn't over her and he wished she would come back. One of his female friends was talking with another friend and asked him what he thought of our relationship, he said we were cute and she said ""he's still not over Hannah (his ex)"". My bf also had a suicide attempt after this girl broke up with him.

TL:DR - I am crazy obsessed with my BF's ex due to an insecurity that he is hung up on her. I'm driving myself crazy with checking her socials, reading his DM's, etc. ",3,2025-01-31 10:08:15,15,0.64,SLIPPYDIPPYY

Hey Reddit, I tried posting this on a bunch of different Reddit areas, but it got removed so I’m trying here I suppose…?
I’m still a teenager (17-NB), and I’m currently dating a very kind and loving man(18-M). We’ve been dating for a month, talking for about 5. Though, I’m still caught up on my ex(forever 15-M)
I love both of them so much. 

I dated my ex for nearly exactly 7 months. Two years ago, and on Christmas Day he died due to self infliction.
I keep missing him, thinking of him nearly every day. I still love him.
I feel guilty for doing so, I feel like and I know I’m not being “faithful”.
My ex and I knew each other for 6 years, we were “soulmates”.

I’ve told my current partner all about my ex, and he says he’s okay with me talking about my ex, but knowing him I’m not 100% sure.
In some of my poems I’ve written about him, and in my book (before my current partner) I’ve even based the love interest off my ex, who I have had ‘change planes of existence’ too.
I think I’m just a grieving person? But I still feel guilty because I really really do love my boyfriend, though I feel like I’m not at the same time because of my ex?
I think I’ve worded this right, I’m happy to answer any questions in the comments.

We started dating in mid 2023 and broke up early 2024. It's not only until recently I realised that she gulit tripped me into losing my virginity. She was very manipulative and would blame me for anything. Not only me though, she did it to everyone around her. It's very hard to describe her actions but I'll try my best. She would have this facade all the time and what threw me off is how fake she was. Right at the beginning of our relationship, she would tell me stories about one of her friends that would belittle her and say she wasn't pretty for me which after we broke up I later found out that was a complete lie. I have no idea why she would make something up like that and it still confuses me now. She also made false rape allegations against an ex boyfriend of hers. I later found out, that was a lie as well. It was like changing my reality and my world view in a way. To believe someone for months about how everyone was out to get her and she had been attacked and belittled for no reason or that people were jealous of her, was a lie and not just one lie but multiple lies and multiple examples of manipulation towards her friends and me, definitely a hard pill to swallow and a weird feeling. Back to my main point, sorry for the rant. She had this tendency to guilt me into things and such weird things as well. When she would be at my place with my parents home, she would get upset if I didn't walk her to the bathroom in my house or open my bedroom door. She would get upset in a way similar to a toddler like stomping the floor, ignoring me and the 5 words that still haunt me ""that makes me feel bad"". I honestly heard those 5 words more than a retail worker listening to Mariah Carey during Christmas season. So when suddenly she asked me 1 night to  have sex with her, I was conditioned so much that if I didn't comply, she would do such horrible things. Blame me, ignore me, tell her friends something untrue, keep in mind, that time we had sex it was my first (not sure for her because everything in that relationship was a lie) I feel like I'm over her but also I'm not because certain things in that relationship I think I will carry for awhile and I recently cannot catch feelings for another individual, like I could before. Having a crush felt like color rushing all around you,but now, for me that color is either so small or non existent which sucks alot.

offmychest,1ie5skw,Some free coffee an kind words just saved my life.,"My (M33) life for the last 3 years has been one disaster after the other, my health deteriorated so badly my gf of 7 years just ghosted me one day, all of my friends have moved on with their life so ill go months without hearing from someone, my big brother died, the grief of that loss took all the amazing parts of my mum an destroyed them. Last week she lost her best friend to lung cancer and today we found out my uncle is likely going to die very soon due to a brain bleed. 

Me an my mum used to be best friends, I can't put into words the lengths she would go to see her kids smile. Seeing her lose so much in such a short and the effect its had on her mental state, has been torture. She lashes out often over small things, she's developed a pretty heavy spending problem on apps on her phone. I don't blame her for these things, she's in so much pain mentally an physically she's doing anything for a distraction. I just help where I can. 

With all of this going on I've had no opportunity to properly grieve the things I've lost, what I used to have, who I used to be, my relationship, my brother, my mum, my friends, my job, my future. I lost it all. 

It will come up in bursts, any moment I am not moving it all starts to bubble up. I'll catch myself on a memory an stumble. Today was one of those days. 

After sitting with my mum an holding her hand while she cried, I headed into town. I needed to get out of the house i just move my feet, no real location or reason to head there. I just needed to move. It's cold where I live right now so I walked into one of my local coffee places an I'm greeted by a girl I've not seen in a few weeks. 

We exchange a few jokes back an forth an I go to make my order, before I could get my card out she's already made my drink an placed it in front of me. 

""Don't worry about it, it's free. Thanks for coming in, I'm glad I got to see you"" 

I don't know this girl very much at all an I haven't had a kind gesture like that in a long time. But it was what she said that hit me so hard, I've not felt appreciated or seen in a such a long time it felt almost alien to me, I even questioned if there was some kind of supervisor watching her an she was just being nice. 

What she probably didn't realise in that moment was that despite the smile I had on, an the jokes. I was seriously considering that coffee being my last, an if she hadn't said those words it probably would have been. 

I sat in the car for 40 minutes an cried for the first time in 3 years, clasping my little cup of caffeinated kindness. 

I feel a little lighter today. 

A little kindness goes a long way.

offmychest,1ie0o64,"If your a self proclaimed ""nice guy,"" you're probably not nice at all.","Today I worked with a man I can't stand. I also worked with him yesterday. 
BACK STORY: He's very big into astrology and will insult you in the name of your sign, ex ""your a Scorpio so you always cheat"" or ""your a Sagittarius so your only materialistic."" He will ONLY apologize after you call him out on his bs and then try and make it seem like your crazy after he just insulted your integrity several times. He usually pulls some BS like ""I'm not saying YOU are, I'm saying your sign is."" After calling YOU a cheater/materialistic/whatever else his baby brain can come up with. If you bring up how he disrespectted you or warn other of what he's doing he gets upset and boohoo case he ""apologized."" He vehemently believes that you do not need to accept his apology, he only cares that he made one and therefore you have to forgive him. He is also a self proclaimed nice guy and thinks he's hot shit and tough. He isn't. 
MAIN STORY: yesterday he spent at least 4 of 10 hours just talking. Standing and talking. I'll keep the deets vague but basically a team of 5 of us had to prep a bunch of items and he had to load the items into boxes. The entire fooking table was full. I had to begin taking that tables product to another table because there was no room left. After a while (at the end of the shift almost) a supervisor told him he was talking too much and needed to work because the rest of us couldn't do more until he did anything. This ignorant little man child decided that since he got told to talk less yesterday, that means he can't talk at all today. So for the first 5 hours he point blank ignored his team. Honestly it was kind of peaceful, but alas, Peace cannot last forever. But in that timeframe we were left clueless because he is the one who chooses what items we prep next and we had to deal with his lil bish boy attitude all day because he was ""agitated."" 
MORAL OF THE STORY: you're probably the exact opposite of nice if you have to say your nice.    ",11,2025-01-31 00:20:50,6,1.0,Environmental_Snow17
offmychest,1iediyo,ENTILTED MOTORIST,"Since bawal mag input ng image, I'll do my best to describe kung ano nangyari. 

– Around Manila East Taytay, may Intersection and papunta akong pa bagong palengke, nasa gitna ako ng Lane kasi straight yung daan ko.

– Itong Entilted motorist naman gusto akong mag bike sa gilid lang, and gusto niya pa atang kumain ako ng 2 Lane para lang makaliko. 

It was arround 11 AM, and I was about to go to school using my bike. It was my daily routine for Friday class. I was just chillin' then around Puregold taytay, this ENTITLED MOTORIST (An Old Man) appeared out of nowhere, he keeps yapping about something. 

Hindi ko na siya pinapansin, since alam ko sa sarili ko na wala namang mali sa ginagawa ko. It was traffic around Puregold Taytay to ACLC when the accident happen. Inunahan niya ako around ACLC kaya napatigil ako since andami niyang sinasabi na di ko naman maintindihan. AND ang gusto niya pala sabihin is GUMILID daw ako? It was traffic and usually laging puno ng  motorcycle sa gilid, kaya sa gitna nalang ako which is the safeties place for bike, and dun rin yung RIGHT LANE para sa pupuntahan ko which is to bagong palengke.

Anyway, nung tumigil siya sa harap ko. Hindi ko na sana siya papansin kaya balak ko sanang umalis nalang, and nung pag pedal ko bigla siyang umandar ng konti sa harap ko kaya nabunggo ako, and nagkaroon ng mahabang sugat around my lower forearm (6 inches slice wound), and nasira din yung School ID ko. After noon, bigla nalang siyang nag accelerate without saying anything. Siguro narealise niya na delikado na siya. 

Since wala akong License, tama ba ang Lane na pinuwestuhan ko. If dun kasi ako sa gilid, para akong t*ngang kumain ng 2 Lane para lang makaliko.

offmychest,1iedi2o,Losing my Scholarship,"I loath the series of events that led up to this BS. I would have accepted if I didn't listen to the lectures, forgotten to do my homeworks, failed my performance tasks, or failed the exam but no, I didn't fail any of those because there was none. 

Zero, null, NADA! 

How lovely of my professor to show up and teach for the preliminary quarter, giving us students a false sense of comradery where you would teach and we would learn. Oh how naive we were. Sure, people get sick and that is why medical leave exist as the right of the employee, but I'm fairly goddamn sure it doesn't last for months without end since my classmates saw you working at the university, just not teaching us. I understand she also works in the registration but come on! How peculiar though, you show up to work but you decide to not teach? Find me the logic in that. Even online classes, she was still missing. So for the rest of the midterms and finals, our professor was AWOL, stealing the tuition we paid, and delaying our final grades.

We did report her to the dean but only after giving the benefit was abused and the damage to our schedule  our schedule was done. So we end with the semester with one course on a limbo. Our dean decided to take control and materials to study, I repeat materials to study, not lectures, so that we can finally take a exam to put grades on. Sounds like a great idea! With the best of intentions! What could possibly go wrong? 

Unfortunately for me, my fuck-up I would like to admit, I didn't saw where we would take the exam. Our dean release the study materials on our messenger group chat which I saw. What my cursed eyes didn't saw   was the Google form link where we would write the answers. Tbh, I was already tired and it was the semestral break. I half-heartedly studied the materials during the break and figured he will send the link. I was gobsmack to learn on January 15, our dean did send the link on the third day of the year and the deadline was on the 10th. Again, I can acknowledge at this instance I was in the wrong for passing the it late, because of my tardiness in this moment, its likely why I was given a grade that drag the rest of my GPA by a point lower than 92; however, this wouldn't had happened had our professor just thought, gave us assignments and quizzes or a damn easy task to do. Our Individual Sports professor couch also didn't bother to teach but at least he gave as a task so we could have grades, but no. Our dean had to stepped in to fix this whole mess. 

I also need to rant a little about our dean. He knows our situation, yet the goddam rubrics on how he scored our exam is infuriating. Its a goddamn essay for goodness sake, 10 questions overall, 5 I guest for both midterm and final grades. Some of my classmates scored a perfect 96 across the board while others varies for no reason. Also infuriating, since I was late, my grades computation was also given late, me only receiving it today. For weeks I searched and pestered the dean to inform him I did pass the exam, wait for his confirmation, and give me the grades so that the registration office can handle my Certificate of Grades. All of that was for naught as my GPA was 91, a point away from the needed 92. Even if I try to argue for a higher grade just for that point, it would be too late. The scholarship department only accepts applications and renewals till tomorrow. If I want to waste my Saturday on betting if the dean is on the campus tomorrow, have him accept my plead, and miraculously conjure up a new Certificate of Grades before 5pm against the kafkaesque bureaucracy of the registration office, I would say a February 1st well spended for absolutely nothing.

  
TLDR: My professor ghosted us after prelims, leaving us without a grade to compute. She was still working at the university but just decided not to teach our class. Our dean had to step in last minute, dropping study materials and an exam link I stupidly missed. My late submission meant I got a lower grade, which tanked my GPA to 91, just one point short of the 92 I needed to renew my scholarship.

  
P.S I'm crying losing a 50% discount. I'm tired and I bloody wish this is over. I will try to find other scholarship being offered at my community but I'm just so tired.",1,2025-01-31 13:18:45,1,0.67,Qules_LP

We argued about it and I learned that he had a threesome with 2 girls before and how they took turns fighting to suck his dick. I got so angry and frustrated and started crying. Things escalated and we were screaming at each other on the phone. 

I was mad. But secretly was really turned on. I say things that riled him up (like how  want to get fucked by other guys, I'm gonna let people gangbang the fuck out of me since he doesn't wanna have sex with me)

He got mad. Later that night he booked a hotel for us and said hes gonna fuck my brains out since Im so horny and desperate. When he opened the door he basically just yanked me by my hair and fuck me. We just started hate fucking each other. I was crying. Through out he was saying shit like is this what I want other guys to do to me. How I want to get fucked. When Im sucking his dick I made me told me about that time 2 girls was sucking his dick. I was horny and mad at the same time.

After we let it all out we calmed down, talked a bit, and cuddled. We made up.

I'm so tired. I know it's toxic. But it was hot af.

I just need to let it out. 

Also I'm so into him. I'm into this shit. But we probably should not really do threesomes. I'd probably feel resentful later down the road. But God was I into it.

As certain saying goes, never make your hobby your job, you just might end up hating it. And to be a professional in the field means you need to be doing it even when you don't feel like it.

offmychest,1idj99n,As a raped man I attempted to commit suicide last night. I will go into a psychological facility soon.,"I have met a woman many months ago who turned out to be an ASPD (psychopath)
She was a sadist, creating humiliating situations for me on purpose. She tortured me in all the possible ways for 4 months straight. You can check my post history for further details.

I was already mentally fragile prior of this relationship because of a skin condition called rosacea. My face has been red and skin peeling off since I was 15 (now 31).
Because of rosacea I became fearful of going out, I got eaten by shame.

Did not have the balls to walk up to a woman and ask for her number, because who wants a man with a red peeling face? A leper.

Who wants a depressive man who can't fix his skin?

Same goes for the job interviews, or a simple coffee in town. Just too ashamed to sit there in public with a face like that.

As I met this woman she gave me reassurance at first, strong reassurance. She liberated me and accepted me the way I was.
But only because she was a sadist who reels weak people in so she can rape them.

Since I was already quite suicidal prior of the abusive relationship, imagine now.

My life is going nowhere, my job is a pain. I'm working 50% and then spending the rest of the day in my thoughts. The thoughts of what she did to me. What my life has become and what I am now as a man, what has become of my soul?

Yesterday, 29th January was her birthday and her family probably celebrated it as they know exactly what she does to the men she brings into her family circle.

I had suicidal thoughts for 7 months (since we broke up) and also started having homicidal thoughts as her birthday was coming up. I know where she lives, she know where I live too.

I thought of buying a gun and putting a bullet through her head and finishing myself off right after that.

Or I simply commit suicide own my own. 

I chose the second option since I'm not a murderer.

But she's out there torturing her new vulnerable prey, his life will be ruined and he'll soon find himself in my shoes. 

She destroyed my psyche.
I have been pushed to the edge of insanity because of this event.

offmychest,1id8jft,I'm going to die soon,"I'm 23 and I'm going to die before summer comes. I've been dealing with what's killing me for more than a year. Despite it all, I managed to get my degree, though I had imagined my graduation to be so so different. Feelings of anguish, despair and unfairness burden me daily. Questions of why now, why like this. I think about the things that I went through in my childhood, the way I endured and overcame and then actually had a few good and happy years. Like it was all for nothing.
I think about my parents, they are already devastated. My mother pretends to be strong, but I know she's breaking. My father is depressed and I can see him fading too. I have no siblings. I'm their only daughter. In the past I've heard that no parent should have to burry their child, and it's true. I'm going to miss them. I'm going to miss my grand mothers too. They were proud of me, and truly love me. I love them too.
I think about my partner. I love him with all my heart. I cry everyday looking at photos we took when I was okay. Photos of our vacation, or of simple moments. I'm not going to be here for his next birthday or for our next christmas. I won't be here to support him on his next job interview. I regret every fihght we ever had. I'm going to miss him more than I can put into words. 
If there's an afterlife, I'm going to miss them all so much. It pains me to know that I'm leaving and they will have to deal with this. I can't stop thinking that what happened to me is unfair. Then again who am I to be spared of suffering. When it first happened, and we thought it was temporary, I tried to view it as a lesson. As a way to change course and get my priorities straight. I tried to make sense of it. Then when it became clear that this isn't just a tough few months, not something temporary, I lost all delusions that this is a lesson. There isn't any meaning in this. What's the meaning of a never ending suffering that will only bring death? The meaninglessness and absurdness of my situation add more layers to my grief. I grief who I was and who I could be. The life I could have had. Everything feels so meaningless. 
I'm going to miss waking up and feeling light and careless. I'm going to miss watching my favourite movies and shows, eating my favourite foods. I'm going to miss going to the beach, swiming, going to new places. I will miss my friends and my cat, a stray tubby that I adopted 6 years ago. She has been by our side during the absolute best and absolute worst moments of my life. 
Thinking all of my wasted potential, my dreams, the things I wanted to do that I can't even remember now. Because this thing has taken away everything that made me me. 
The irony is that to some extend, it's almost like I always knew. For some reason, I could never think of myself going past my early 20s. And months before it all begun, I felt a heaviness, not one that was physical. I guess life has its unique way to make cruel jokes to some of us. I'm bitter, because that's not how I wanted it to be at all. Because I thought I could have a chance. But I'm also relieved that the suffering is coming to an end. And I know that even though my loved ones will hurt, they will eventually come to a point where they will find joy in life and will remmeber me with only love and not pain. 
I wanted to see what these ages will bring. How fashion, technology and cinema will be. And most importantly, I wanted to help people. Any way I could. 
It all makes me realise how little control I have over anything. I used to thing that every problem had a solution, that we can overcome anything. Life had to prove me wrong. Almost feels like I'm being punished for having been hopeful. Anyway, enough whining. After all it is what it is and I should leave bitterness aside for my last days on earth.
That's all. I'm not sure what's the point of sharing this with people online. All I have to say, as cliche as it sounds, enjoy life and don't take things too personally. Don't sink too deep into problems that can be solved easily. And always try to find joy, no matter what it is. Even if it's just listening to a song you like, watching a movie, or eating your favourite snack. Cheers!

Only God knows the number of times I’ve been so tempted to reach out to my ex but I guess I realized that there’s so much to learn?? Does that make sense

Like everyday I choose not to reach out I realize things slowly

It’s not clear but I guess right now the memo is that it hurts so much, so many what ifs, so much hurt but it’s also telling me that I’ll be okay. I’ve been okay. It’s like I’m realizing that if I can do this today I can do this everyday?? Does that make sense?? Cause I guess idk the first few days of the break up was just rlly brutal for me and it didn’t feel like I was gonna be able to keep no contact. Does that make sense??? But yeah no everyday I am able to successfully not reach out to him I realize that I’ can actually be okay like ok ok typa ok. 

It’s been almost 2 months now since our break up and I’ll be honest if feels like fucking forever and I’m really not ok. (But I’m also ok) I’ve been just trying to get by day by day. I act like everything is ok but people around me like my roommates actually really know that he’s still all I talk about 😭😭 it’s so fucked up im crying just typing this because literally I don’t know what to say where to put all these emotions :( i genuinely from the bottom of my heart love him very much. I hate the things that he said, the things he did and did not do but i am still able to separate the person from the words and actions and i really really genuinely have so much love for him and it’s killing me that im in this position.

I guess what im trying to say is that I realized or am realizing day by day that maybe the love stays and that maybe these like not being together, and just the situation in general can coexist. Does that make sense??? 

I actually just fell down a flight of stairs 🤣 idk maybe that’s why I’m so emotional I don’t know but I guess the first thing that came into my head was well I wanted to call him and cry to him :( I wanted to hear him freak out that I fell down a freaking flight of stairs :( it’s crazy and it’s funny how I thought of him.. not even my brother or my family lol

That’s pretty fucked..

But even then, I can still kind of compartmentalize  and separate these emotions, my feelings, and reality. I just hope that idk I’ll be genuinely happy about this one day and genuinely happy for him when he finds the happiness I wanted to give him in his life

For now idk the pain is still very much real. The emotions are still a bit raw and unprocessed. I just feel defeated today I guess but again silver lining, I’m really still doing relatively okay given it all. I am ok I’ll be ok I will be okkkkkkkkkk",2,2025-01-31 08:38:54,1,1.0,aquaspiced

offmychest,1iecfpi,People spoiling the latest TV shows and movies is worse than ever,"I am getting so sick and tired of how many times I'm having recent releases of movies or TV shows spoiled for me on social media. 

Back in the day people would usually put a big spoiler warning at the top of their post, or at least use words in the post that you could mute. Not anymore, people just post important spoilers or screenshots or pictures or videos and there's little you can do to avoid it other than staying off social media until you've had a chance to catch up. 

Two most recent examples were Nosferatu, I was really looking forward to going in with little to no info, I only watched the first trailer but due to where I live it wasnt released here as quickly as everywhere else. But literally a day after the movie came out people were posting pictures and videos they'd taken at the cinema showing Count Orlok's design or key scenes and moments from the movie. I always try to quickly scroll past but it's not always possible to clock on immediately to what you're looking at. And it just pisses me off because everyone deserves to have the experience those people posting had, of going in not knowing what you're going to see and enjoying the surprises. 

The second most recent one was for the latest episode of Severance. I live in the UK, and by 9.30am I had already seen a tonne of screenshots, plot details of the episode and theories from the episode too. This is despite having muted several keywords from the show. For a show like Severance especially so much of the enjoyment comes from figuring out and discovering these things on your own. Some of us work full-time and can't stay up late to watch it or watch it first thing in the morning. 

It's really just pissing me off, I don't know if it's a Gen Z or Gen Alpha thing but it never used to be this bad. People were generally aware of spoiling things. If you're really so desperate to discuss these things then go find a fucking forum or a sub Reddit and join in the spoiler chat there and let the rest of us enjoy it the same way you did.

Sorry, rant over, the Severance spoilers just pushed me over the edge this morning and it's my favourite show at the moment and the best way to enjoy it is going in completely blind.",0,2025-01-31 12:10:33,0,0.5,StylanPetrov

Two years ago, they decided to leave their family’s firm, which we both agreed was for the best since it carried too much emotional baggage. When they left, they ended up cutting contact with their family entirely. They had never really worked outside of the firm before so it was a huge transition for them.
While they were between jobs, they started VTubing as a hobby and it suddenly blew up. They became very popular and now their streams have more viewers than my YouTube channel ever had in subscribers. It’s tough seeing someone succeed in the area I’ve always dreamed of. It feels worse knowing it happened so quickly by chance, while I’ve been working non-stop to support us.
Still, despite all of this, I am proud of them. They stepped into an entirely new world, built something for themselves, and found success. I just wish I didn’t feel so bitter about it.

TLDR: partner became vtuber and got popular in a short time while I shelfed my dream to support them. And I'm becoming jealous.",0,2025-01-31 11:58:04,2,0.33,No-Mirror-4874

offmychest,1iec4sz,"My 'best friend' stabbed me in the back, and now I'm the one losing everything.","In June 2024, my ex-friend deceived me for weeks, making me doubt my own sanity by telling me I was paranoid, all while getting closer to a girl I had liked for a long time. In the end, they got together and destroyed my world. When I tried to confront him, his only response was, ""What I did wasn't great, but you deserved it for being rude."" He then tried to make me look bad by inventing a story that I slapped him.

The worst part is that I always knew he wasn’t a great person. He’d treated his ex terribly, had questionable opinions, and on more than one occasion, threw me under the bus to save himself. He even once told me that if he were with his old friends, they’d laugh at me. I thought it was a joke.  However, I figured that even if he was sorta an ass, he ought to be a good friend inside. I was wrong.

Interestingly, the girl  knew all of this. After he broke up with his ex for the fourth and final time, she said, ""The next girl who dates him is an idiot."" But within weeks, he managed to convince her that he was the only one who truly listened to her. And when he asked her out, he did it right after telling her I had feelings for her, ensuring that their relationship started with one last humiliation towards me. She said his last issues were just “alcohol and parental problems”. Nevermind he treated me like shit just a week before, I guess.

Months have passed, and nothing has improved. I can’t be around him without spiraling into a mental crisis. My mental health is at rock bottom, but my friends, though they say they understand, act like nothing’s wrong. They keep inviting us both, so if I want to avoid him, I end up isolating myself. One even told me, ""If I were in your shoes, I would’ve committed suicide, but well, I don’t really care about your situation."" The rest are kinder, but their support ends up being the same. I’ve always been loyal to all of them; I didn’t expect this. 

¿Am I not worth fighting for, not even a little? ¿Why is my presence a convenience, not a want or need? ¿Why have I failed to make my friends, some of whom I’ve known forever, give a damn about me? ¿Can I not bond?

I feel trapped in a situation where I have to choose between my dignity and my social life. Either I give in and act like nothing happened, or I keep isolating myself until I lose all my friends. The worst part is that while I’m still destroyed, my ex-friend is acting like nothing happened and seems to have been rewarded for his actions.
And everyone keeps telling me the same thing: ""Forget it,"" ""Move on,"" ""It only affects you."" I was betrayed, humiliated, and now I’m being left behind. Why do I have to lose everything? How can it be that I’m suffering through all of this, and yet they still act like it’s my fault? It doesn’t seem fair. I can’t accept that this is how it ends. I feel the need to fight this situation with everything I have.

I’m desperate and falling apart. What can I do?

offmychest,1id9zij,My boyfriend has a “work wife” and she’s trying to steal him.,"Me (21F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for a little over 2 years now. Everything with his is fantastic. This year we are long distance because I’m finishing up school while he graduated last year and is working. He has given me nothing to distrust him. 

The work wife, Chastity (not real name obvi but her real name also sounds like a stripper name 🤷‍♀️) has worked at this job for 3 years and my bf has worked there for about 5 months. She was part of the hiring committee and the manager over all the interns and trainees. 
I knew her position had her working with my bf to teach him the ropes. I didn’t think her position “required” her to be with him all day every day after he is done training. 

My bf has continually reassured me there is nothing going on and I still trust him. I met her a few months ago and she couldn’t be more excited to see me. She said she’s heard a lot about me. I saw her just a few days ago for the second time and she wanted nothing to do with me. It was in a group setting, everyone was talking. Chastity was talking with my bf mostly. As I joined in to talk with the group, with her included, she physically turned her back on me. I shrugged it off thinking nothing of it. 

Yesterday, my bf calls me saying he got into a little trouble at work. He said his boss pulled him into his office to say he has been talking with Chastity too much. I asked him if he is the one initiating these interactions and he says no, that chastity will email him from her desk to ‘help’ on some work stuff and talk with him instead once he gets there (he showed me the emails he was not lying). He then proceeded to enlighten me that the entire office calls chastity his work wife. Great. Then also says Chastity has asked him to come over to her house several times after work and has invited him out drinking several times. 

So she’s now his work wife, getting him into trouble at work, inviting him to non work related outings, and has the audacity to turn her back on me. I wanted my bf to have work friends to talk about work stuff, but this is stepping over everything. I want to know if anyone else thinks me being pissed and unhappy about her presence is irrational or not. ",477,2025-01-30 01:59:47,45,0.97,Upbeat-Practice9302
offmychest,1id2f6f,I fucking hate korea.,"I'm a native korean and am 16 yrs old.

Pessimistic and insecure people, individualistic, depressed, and closed-minded attitudes, dirty streets, horrible and toxic education system and work culture, terrible environment (air pollution, trash on the streets that no one cleans, etc.), superiority complex and so on. I hate this country with all my heart. 

You think it's not that bad? Oh yes. Yes, it is. One of the main reasons Koreans struggle with depression is the toxic education system and the overall environment here.

Let me give you a little simulation of what your life would be like if you were Korean to help you understand. 

You always have to worry/ be scared about what others think of you and make sure you don’t act even a little differently or unique from others, or they’ll gossip. And always look your best when you’re outside.
Oh and even raising your hand to ask a question in class can draw gazes so be careful.
And some people (usually kids) might even make fun of your skin, using slurs like the N-word if your skin is darker than theirs.
And as a student, You spend your middle and high school years studying, constantly stressed from all the pressure and competition. But you push through and finally graduate. Are you happy now? No. Because now you have to get a job which is extremely difficult and stressful all over again. Will you be happy once you secure a job? Oh no, of course not. Sure, it depends, but if you can't tolerate the work culture here, then good luck.

 So what's the conclusion? You just spent your entire youth stressed out for nothing. Congratulations.

I want to immigrate. I want to leave so badly. I hate everything here, and being in this country only deepens my depression. I see nothing good in it. 

And I don't understand why, I will not understand but some people act like they know everything and always think they're right. And so many people are full of stereotypes.
I hate the way they think everything will go exactly as they expect. Oh you don’t fucking know that. You can’t judge what exactly will happen just because you’ve been through it once. If everything always went the way you thought it would you’d be a world famous billionaire predictor or some shit by now.
What's with this fucking superiority complex? 
Additionaly Every time I say I'm going to immigrate, which is my future plan, someone always goes, 'Oh, you think it's better out there? You're just too young to understand. This country is better anyway. Other countries are individualistic and dangerous.' What the fuck? 
They've never even experienced living a single day abroad. so how the fuck do they know what's better or not? Why do they think they can judge? Their only perspective on foreign countries comes from the news. as if their own country wouldn't look terrible too if they only saw it through the media

I fucking hate this tiny country and its people. I know not everyone is bad, but my hatred toward my own people grows worse every day. And the more it gets worse the more depressed I become. I'm going to escape this country as soon as possible, or I'll go insane. ",1272,2025-01-29 20:34:34,165,0.96,i-wont-make-a-name
offmychest,1ie6p4k,I’m in love with this person but I’m so conflicted about asking them out. Stuck between a rock and a hard place,"

I (22 F) am a college student. I have a crush on this person (goes by any pronouns but for these purposes I will refer to them as G). G and I have been friends for a short while, about a year and a half to two years now. Every time I hang out with G, I’m always so so happy to be in their presence. They are sweet, super funny, so incredibly talented and passionate about what they want to do with their life and overall just make my heart sing. Sometimes, at parties with mutual friends, we get physical (cuddling/hugging only, sitting close on the same couch things like that). 

There is one incredible problem though. My parents want me to have biological children. G is AFAB and I’ve found myself not really caring about the gender or sex of person I am interested in. Unfortunately, I haven’t come out to my parents and I never ever will. I live far enough away that they don’t know of my extended friend group and we only communicate by call. They have made it pretty clear that I should marry and man and have children.

 I’m a child of two immigrant parents from a country with a maternally focused culture. My extended family are all getting old and dying out and my sister and I are the only two women in the family to carry on the name and the assets of the family. My mom is the holder of the family name (+ other important things) and she will be passing it down to me (as I am the eldest daughter). I know my mom wants nothing more than to be a grandmother and she makes that known to me and my sister frequently. I don’t really ever see myself having kids but I don’t really mind if it’s with the right person.  I, personally, don’t think my mental health is at an all time high and I don’t want to bring a kid in the equation until I get some therapy or get medicated + work on myself a little more. They don’t want me to adopt because while the child would still be loved, they wouldn’t be blood and I couldn’t pass on the assets to them.

I don’t want to cut my family off because 1. I love them very much and 2. They’ve paid for everything I own. My college tuition to a pretty good school, my apartment rent and groceries. They’ve given me the opportunity to follow my wildest career dreams and a chance at success. Im so happy at the college I chose and I love living here. I’m very very lucky to have them and I am eternally grateful for all of the hard work they’ve put into immigrating to the country to provide a good home and a good life for us. Additionally, the culture we come from a very respect based, and defying them feels like a nightmare to me. My siblings and I are also very very close and I can’t lose them. I can’t lose them and my parents after everything they’ve done for me but it breaks my heart to know I won’t be truly able to love who I want to love. But that’s life I guess. 

As a result, I’ve been fending off people who want to date me by saying I’m aromantic (which I believe that I am demiromantic) and ""not looking for anyone right now."" However, some days the loneliness gets so painful that it’s driven me into a deep depression and I sometimes don’t know how I can live on like this. When G and I became friends, I started to feel that twinge of a crush and I distanced myself from them. They’ve been so kind and I can’t stand being around them because I can’t get over this crush. Usually, I’m good at pushing down feelings into nothing but this time, the feeling is too overwhelming. They take up my every thought and all of my dreams and all I want to do is ask them out. I have an inkling that they like me back based on all the shared physical contact we have but I can’t say for sure. 

However, I really don’t want to drag my problems into their life. They do not deserve to battle the fact that my parents will never accept them and the emotional turmoil of having a partner choose their family over you is too great of a burden for me to put on someone like that. I can’t be selfish and say I want something short term because I don’t. It would be so so insensitive to drag them into a relationship with me and my shitty homophobic family when they’ve completely accepted their gender + sexuality and are very open about being lgbtq. They don’t deserve that and I love them too much as a friend to do that to them

My mental health is declining as a result. The loneliness is killing me. Sometimes it’s so bad that I can’t go to classes. I’m not the most attractive person so I’ve only been pursued romantically a handful of times (that didn’t go anywhere) and never by the men my parents would want me to date (never by men at all actually). I don’t know if I should suck it up and marry a man in some sort of loveless marriage or just never date at all. My siblings say that I should be a single mother, but I’m asexual and pretty aversive to sex with another person. My parents don’t ever seem like they would come around to me being lgbtq (having floated the idea many times and then violently shooting it down) so I’m kind of stuck here.

Would love advice but no need to. Just needed to get this off my chest I guess. Trying the whole burner account thing so this dosent get traced back to me",3,2025-01-31 05:24:02,0,1.0,Funny-Somewhere6607
offmychest,1idzafa,Why do people care so much about how a random person looks like,"My entire life, I have people call me names and pretty much made fun of me for how I looked. I don't even look that bad- I have black hair, small brown eyes, a big round button nose, small ears, big lips, I have eye bags, I have long skinny arms, and my fashion sense is OK. I'm a girl that is mixed with Creole, French, and native American.

They would mostly compare me with random people and objects. There had been times where people would do a ""smash or pass"" and unsolicitly bring me in it and it's always a ""pass"" 

people would even do that annoying prank where they would go up to me and say that someone has a crush on me and ask me to follow them, when I do their friend would insult my appearance and or threaten their friend as if I'm the worst looking person they have ever met. 

I just don't get it. I never acted overconfident about my looks, I never made fun of someone for their looks (In fact, I just don't give a shit on how a random person looks like), I'm not even overly preachy about this type of stuff, I don't even ask for these people's advice or criticism, I don't go inside random people's business or drama and keep to myself, 

I'm not looking for validation for my looks or anything, I'm just wondering why so many different people call me ugly and use my own looks against me.

offmychest,1ie27e5,being gay makes me feel like a commodity,"I 20M don’t always want to be gay. Being gay has always made me feel alone. Not many people can experience the change in perception and demeanor that I see when someone figures out I am gay. I don’t parade around wearing rainbows. I dress like a regular 20 year old man. It’s not the first thing I say when I meet someone for the first time. But somehow that doesn’t matter it’s always the same face of realization. The same moment of ‘oh this guy is gay, I must ask him questions about it’. It’s the same question every time. ‘Are you a top/bottom?’ ‘when did you figure it out?’ ‘ are you sure?’ ‘I’ve always wanted a gay friend/brother’. I hate it. I’m expected to be camp and proud. I just want to live my life but that doesn’t seem to be in the cards. 

People often think that they don’t do this. They do. It’s either they get ecstatic or they treat you completely different to another man. In some peoples eyes I’m too gay to be a real man or too much of a man to not be. I’m asked to speak like a gay person and dress like one. 

I get stares when I walk down the street with my boyfriend, or hold his hand in public. I’m treated like an animal walking on a tightrope.

Today I woke up and realized that I don’t have any plan for what I want or should do today. It’s like im stuck in some vicious cycle of doing the same things the same way over and over with no opportunity to grow. I will probably end up playing video game or half-watching youtube videas till im bored, and cycle to the next app like reddit or twitter just to kill time. It’s like I dont’t even have ideas of what I want to do, I don't internally feel it, cause even things I slightly want to do – like crochet or jigsaw puzzle feel like a chore and another responsibility just to cross of the list. I don’t have enough drive to do them. I also feel really burned out with no direction to follow – I have just finished my second to last semester of doing bachelor at college, but a year earlier I came to the conclusion that this major isn’t for me, and I’m only here just to prove to myself I can finish it. I constantly compare myself to my friend group which I really adore, but at the same time completely despise for the envy they cause inside me. They all seem so natural and better at everything they do – the way they carrry themselves, their style, their intelligence, their ideas, their social skills, their drive and their hard work to improve in their hobbys – all of this is making me sick. I wish I could stop doing that and just look at them as my inspiration to get better but its not so easy to do when I constatly feel worse than them. I feel like inherently there is something missing inside me – some part of me is maybe malfunctioning and needs to be fixed cause why the hell I am crying while writing this post. Some days Im really fine I swear – I feel like I fit in, I do all the right things and say the correct stuff and I feel happy, but man – sometimes I feel like I have no personality, nothing to say and just such terrible tunnel vision and narrow outlook on things. I feel like there’s some kind of internal blockade inside me that stops me from listening to music my friends recommend, or other stuff like books or podcasts. I’m resentful, I’m cynical and just like in Fleabag confession monologue I just wish that someone would tell me what to do, cause it all feels like a cruel joke.

I asked him what happened and he said I squirted. I didn’t even realise I do this and thought he’s lying. Then he mentioned how this happens almost every time we have sex. I felt so embarrassed for causing such a mess and he reassured me saying it’s okay at least he’s doing something right. 

What confuses me is how I always make sure I pee before sex. So how does this happen? Where does the liquid come from 😭

offmychest,1ie8hrj,I don't know how to help my girlfriend leave her toxic family.,"Sorry for the length or randomness of it all, I've only ever heard reddit posts, never written one.

I don't want to give away too many details as her parents might find this post, but I don't know what to do anymore. My girlfriend has 2 extremely conservative, traditional, strict latino parents.

She's the oldest (18) of many, many siblings, which means that she has always been the second mom of the family, babysitting the younger ones, sharing her phone with all her siblings (they all know her passcode), not being able to hang out with her friends because she had to be with her family or was stuck babysitting. I remember distinctly from high school, when she had to wait outside the moment they arrived to pick her up, because they would arrive and berate her if she wasn't outside within 10-25 seconds of them arriving (I'm not exaggerating), they quite literally spammed her. When I asked her about her sleepovers in passing, she told me that she's never had a sleepover despite having two friends that her parents have met and trust profusely. 

During high school, she would work during the summer and save 100% of her money in a bank account managed by her parents, if she ever spent money she would have to ask permission and if not, they would question her within 25-35 seconds of her spending it. It was a normal occurence that one of her parents would take money out of her account in order to spend it on gifts they forgot to get and would not pay the money back until the other parent and my girlfriend pressed them for months, I'm talking hundreds to thousands of dollars. She never learned how to actually manage her money or spending, never learned how to shop for anything on her own, never understood how to protect herself financially. Her bank accounts are still set up so that her parents can manage them and see all transactions. I should mention that the family is financially not well off which is what made me think it to be normal or even ok at the time.

Her family uses multiple tracking apps on the kids with phones (life360, find my, etc.) and checks them constantly. If she moves from the pre-designated locations, her parents will question her about her whereabouts, sometimes even asking for proof (pictures, videos, ft, etc.). At some points, I'd even create plans that took months to make, just to work around the tracking apps so that we could hang alone on dates (her siblings still come with us on dates). I've spent the last 3 1/2 years doing my best to earn their respect and trust as I believed that was the only way to actually get her away from there, so we could spend time at a park just so she could experience peace.

When she went off to college for her first semester, I've never seen her more calm and happier. She would talk about how quiet the dorm parties were compared to her home, how she could actually sleep and was happy. She told me she made friends, she could express herself and not have to feel bad about it. I could tell it wasn't going to last though. She burned through her money (out-of-state tuition, food, etc.) and was barely scraping by the last part of the semester, she got a job but got so few hours that she was still not making enough money to stay. To their credit, her parents did send whatever they could to help her as much as possible. The worst part, she kept telling me that she was homesick, missing her family (mainly the siblings) and how she was drowning in the current situation but that she couldn't go back. I should also say at this point that her and her dad have heavy issues and he would constantly tell her in private conversation to come back home, which only fueled her desire to stay away, as she didn't want to prove him right. One of the big contributing factors was that extended family that lived near her immediate family told her that she could rent a room for a small fee from them so that she could stay with family at home while having the privacy and silence she needed, she would complete her degree online. She came back home, and waited expectedly for that extended family member to let her use the room, after a while of nothing, they told her that they just couldn't do it anymore.

 Now she's back home and living with family, the catalyst for my writing this post is that she texted me tonight, crying that she doesn't regret coming back home (being with family I assume) but she wishes she never left her dorm. She said that if she were to ever show any emotion to her parents, she's afraid of the consequences, that they'll retaliate. Her parents still believe in corporal punishment (to some extent, I've never seen it myself) and she's afraid that her mom would slap her to get her to shut up.  

I don't know what to do at this point, I've spent years saving up everything I can so that one day I can get her out of the house (somewhat amicably), her parents are highly religious and will only let that happen when I marry her. I've got my own personal reasons for waiting so long to marry her. Every time I've ever presented some kind of solution, she's been too afraid to try anything out of fear of retaliation.  It hurts me so much to see her like this, crying in silence, not even able to walk outside her house without her parents permission. I've tried to think of something, but almost everything I think of is too extreme or involves her doing it (which she'd be too afraid of to do). I don't have enough money to financially support her and most of our friends are broke college kids. I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm at my last straw and just want to ask for help. Please.

  
TL;DR

My girlfriend has extremely strict Latino parents who control her finances, whereabouts, and emotions. She briefly experienced freedom in college but had to return home due to financial struggles, and now feels trapped and afraid to express herself. I’ve been saving to help her leave, but I’m not ready to marry yet (which is the only way her parents would allow her to go). She’s too scared to try any solutions, and I’m desperate for advice.

  
As an added note, on the extremely unlikely chance that some channel finds this. I ask you to please not spread this, I don't want too much attention on this post as her parents could retaliate against her as a result. Thank you.",2,2025-01-31 07:13:36,2,0.67,Capital-Carry-4755

offmychest,1ieb5a1,I Don't Want To Go To My Family Reunion,"I moved to a different state about two years ago. It was a really big change for me and it's been a little hectic - job changes, relationships beginning and ending etc. Most of my family (especially my immediate family) is older than me and are very secure in what they are doing and don't have many worries. They don't seem to acknowledge this and assume I can drop what I'm doing at any given moment. Case in point, they expect me to spend several hundred (thousand?) dollars to come to a family reunion thousands of miles from where I live. 

At first I was on board but, with time, I am having doubts. The travel costs could easily cost more than a month's rent and I'm sure I'll end up spending even more on other things while I'm there. More importantly, I have zero communication with my extended family. Long story, my grandparents moved to a different part of the country several decades ago. My mother did not go with them. As such, that part of the family grew up literally within an hour of each other, I grew up 10 hours away. We have little to nothing in common and they have never made an effort to get to know me. 

To share an anecdote - the last time we had a family reunion we showed up at the house they were all staying at to see them. They were all playing cards at the table, not one person at that table got up to say ""Hi"" to me, they barely acknowledged I was there. 

Blah blah blah. Why should I waste my time seeing these people?",1,2025-01-31 10:34:04,3,1.0,ofthedappersort
offmychest,1ieecmw,I can't help it but I can't stand most young women,"(I say young because I do not have experiences with women over the age of 25.)

The relationships I had with men and women were complicated my entire life. Both my mother and father were terrible people, my female friends and my boyfriend as well, so as a teenager I was going through periods of internalized misogyny and misandry. I hated men and women and myself.

Right before my 20s I closed myself off to the world and removed myself from society. Ended basically all friendships and stopped communicating with people. Thanks to the lack of human interactions, my hatred for both genders really calmed down. At least until now...

After years of isolation, I wanted to reconnect with people and went to talk in online groups. After reading interactions between people, having interactions with women myself and ruminating upon my past, I can't help but feel like I fucking can't stand women again... Which also makes me hate myself for being associated with the gender.

I've noticed that women in general are ironically much more aggressive than men. In their opinions, their behavior, their moral beliefs, their emotions, everything. Friendships with men aren't very emotionally satisfying, as men don't really connect on an emotional level, but they're in general much calmer, so I prefer their company. It's very difficult to offend a man, whereas with women, arguments are much more common and much more heated.

Examples: As a kid I'd be openly bullied by my guy classmates, and sure that sucked, but the damage women did to me was much worse, as they'd first befriend me and then bully me after I've accepted them as a friend. It was so insidious. Dudes would call me ugly, but girls would befriend me, hang out with me every day, and then proceed to throw jabs at me like ""i couldn't understand how someone with such a beautiful name could be so ugly"", or (after catching up after a while) ""you may start talking, it won't take long since your life is boring"", or ""your boyfriend must really like your personality"". They'd always give me an annoyed look when I made a joke, or would ignore me if there were other women present. Women were always the ones that would be morally policing me, even if I made fun of stuff that traumatically affected ME, not them (death of a relative, abuse and stuff). I use dark humor a lot and I find it hilarious, and it was always women who'd take it upon themselves to call me terrible names for using it. I would often see women openly saying how men suck while they themselves would lash out if they received comments like that back. It'd always be women who'd somehow take my feelings and issues personally, and get offended based on an assumption they made about my words. Arguments with women were always the absolute worst, as you could be friends for 8 years, and they'd easily ghost and block you, ending the entire friendship over one disagreement. Simply pretending you never existed. Once I told a ""friend"" that she talked with me only because I was friends with her girlfriend... She proceeded not to talk with me for 4 months, then she apologized, we reconnected, but once those two broke up, she (as I expected) completely cut contact with me. Also, the relationship ended because she cheated... I know one acquaintance of mine was sleeping around with married men. Another one would be cheating on her boyfriend, saying ""it doesn't matter who I sleep with as long as I come back to him in the end"". Besides that, female colleagues were always much more cruel to me than the male ones, because while the men would do their best to help, women would mostly just insult me and say I suck at my job.

All of this makes me lose a tremendous respect for women in general. And sure, I get it, it's not all women, and men suck too, I experienced it first hand, I experienced male violence first hand, but I just can't help but feel the female toxicity much more in my immediate surroundings. I'd describe it as a death by a thousand cuts. I'm so sick and tired of women being always so on edge. I do not consider male friendships a peek of human companionship, but oh my god, at least around men I can freely speak all day long and no one will get offended, whereas with women, they will get upset about something and escalate the argument, expecting me to solve their emotional turmoil that they can't control.

Some of the most fulfilling friendship I've ever had was with a woman (tho she was very masculine), but I feel like trying to be friends with a woman is such a huge hit or miss, it's not worth the nerves, because most of the time, it'll end in a huge argument.",0,2025-01-31 14:06:13,0,0.38,eternal_ttorment

offmychest,1ieariq,I don't know how to get over this confusing betrayL,"My partner did something really awful and disgusting. Not quite illegal, not quite cheating but truly something that if I got specific about would appall you. 
I don't know what to do and I emotions oscillate constantly. I haven't told anyone. I feel betrayed and revolted but also a lot of pity. I'm also terrified. Part of me feels like I must leave, if not now then in the future inevitably. But we married so young and he has supported my whimsical career aspirations. I don't have credit. I don't have a full time job. He works in banking and a main contribution he gives to our household is money management. We've been together 10 years and he's never been anything but a great teammate, gentle partner and fun friend. 
What he did doesn't feel real until I think hard about it and then I feel sick. I can't imagine living the rest of my life with the burden of this knowledge alone. But my ""fawn"" response makes me act completely differently around him. I told him he has to start therapy, I've put a ton of boundaries in place. He is so deeply disturbed by his own behavior and deeply regretful. But I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't figured it out. I am paranoid he will do more of this thing but worse to the point of crimes. I'm gambling on him getting his shit together if he stays and if he doesn't I will be seen as an enabler. 

Am I an enabler? I'm heartbroken and I feel bad for him. He clearly has deep trauma that brought him to this point and my heart keeps saying he's never hurt me before. He's been so good to me as I struggled through mental health issues and sparse employment and family drama. Maybe I should hang on and fight for him. But then I think about how unequal this could make us, how every time I've asked for something since I figured it out, or any time we've had to make a decision he defaults to me as penance. And if I'm honest, I feel far less able to compromise my wishes knowing how much I'm risking if I stay with him. 

It sounds so horrible, but i was supposed to go back to school this summer. I was supposed to be able to travel for my small business job. I just got my dental and mental health back on track (besides the last month since I found out where I've ceased to function and thought about leaving this plane just to not have to go through this) My life will be ruined for years by starting over and he would be mostly fine.

In all my life I've been told I love you 4 times and one was by a stranger that gave me a rose and a paper that said (Song of Solomon 4:7 You are altogether beautiful, my love;there is no flaw in you.). It must have hit me hard that day bc i cried myself to sleep that day when i got home.I have no friends except for one but we don't talk the last time was new years and before that in July where we share a birthday week.saddly i think even that will diminish since he is getting married in February but I wish him the best. Personaly i have dated but it's been more than 9years since then and when that ended it was bc she was cheating.I won't lie I have tried suicide once but it was actually my golden retriever that stopped me when she tackle me as I was about to use my gun. I lost her in the same year in 2020 but since then I have moved in my brother's in with me they think it's bc I'm doing them a solid to get away from my folks but the reality is it's for my own benefit. I'm more afraid of them finding me dead in a pool of my own blood than to actually finish what I started in 2020. The only good thing about me is that financially I'm doing well I made a small business and I have no debt which that's saying something in this economy. I own all my cars, property, and house on some land. I try to do my part by eating healthier now and going to the gym but that little voice that says I'm worthless is always there.

I can't even date because that voice pops up every time with negative question like what can you bring to the table you are overweight, not tall enough, you are antisocial, ugly,waste of space, not financially enough, will she actually love you for you, and the main one can you actually love her? How when you don't even know how to love since you don't even love yourself. I match with people that I always end up just leaving in matched. I have gone to therapy but all I have learned is that I'm broken but I already knew that it only confirmed it on paper. That doesn't help me on how  to fix it. I don't even know what kind of help I need. Do I need help on how to feel better, how to overcome it or how to live with it while I'm in solitude.

i know what causes them: its current events and politics. theyre mainly directed towards the right wing, and as of recently for obvious reasons, towards certain political figures and their supporters. i wanted to stop paying attention to these things after november, but i havent been able to escape it and its affecting me a lot more than it did before, especially since these recent events affect both myself and people i love and care about.

when i say violent thoughts, i dont just mean thoughts about punching or kicking the people involved. i mean genuinely distressing thoughts about bludgeoning, stabbing, mauling, or murdering these people, whether it be me or others doing it. **i would never, and i mean never, act on these thoughts** but the fact that i have them to begin with is worrying and i dont know what to do. not to mention that ive started to actively wish for these things to happen, making me unsure if i can truly call them intrusive thoughts.

i cant ignore it. i cant ignore as the world draws parallels between us and WW2 germany. i cant ignore as the quality of life for people who arent cis/het white men lowers drastically day by day the longer these people are in power. but i cant continue following it.

I don't think I'm unattractive. I'm not overweight, I go to the gym regularly, and I do get compliments from women from time to time.

It's not like I'm lonely because I don't have any friends. I'm out and being social 2 or 3 times a week. I'm always doing something and I appreciate that I have people to do that with because I know not everyone has that. I really do.

I have no problem talking to anybody, I'm a very confident speaker and I'm confident in who I am. I like who I am. This works great for making friends. Just people to hang out with yk. But when it comes to moving further than just friends I have no idea how to do that. So much so that I'm usually just the ""I feel like we would be good friends"" guy and never anything more than that.

offmychest,1ie6yit,Im so lonely in my marriage. I developed a crush on someone I met on a work trip.,"Throwaway because I feel like an enormous dirtbag and have nobody to tell. I've been pretty lonely in my marriage for a while now. I won't go into the details because I don't like complaining about her,  but I feel pretty disconnected from my wife for a myriad of reasons. I truly give my best effort in being a good husband but have had plenty of fuckups too and fully accept fault for anything I've done to damage our relationship. 

I have never physically cheated on my wife, but have definitely developed a distinct crush on a coworkers over the past week.

I went out of state for a week long training and she was in the class. She caught my eye the second I saw her. She has an intense gaze, slanted brows, and high cheekbones. She wears her mountain of hair in a tall bun and gazes at me through a clean pair of glasses. Shes slender, and probably a couple inches taller than me. She's incredibly friendly and personable. Her rich, sexy voice absolutely melts me. Ive never met anyone like her. 

We spent some time hanging with each other in a group the past few evenings but took a short walk, had lunch, and sightsaw briefly at a garden after work, just the two of us. I presume that she isn't interested in me at all, becuse she genuinely seems like a very sweet woman that is being friendly. 

We had a other group hang tonight. Everybody had a great evening, and when we all got up to go back to our rooms, we walked to the elevator alone together and she complemented me on how knowledgeable I was in our field. I absolutely melted inside. I can't believe how hard it hit me. I thanked her and told her she was too and kept it professional and kept the convo going. We rode up the elevator together, chatting until I got out, the doors closed and we shouted a quick goodnight to each other.

I'm so fucking heartbroken right now. I'm crushing on this woman that works in another part of the country, and the chances of us crossing paths again are low. 

I hate this. I found myself in a similar situation about a year ago with someone else. It was not this bad though. I'm sobbing over how good she made me feel. I can't believe that she actually wanted to hang out with me. I really dread saying goodbye to her tomorrow. 

I gotta figure this out. I can't keep doing this to myself .

offmychest,1iea4sj,work overpaid me and im nervous,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 22F working as a supply staff at various childcare centers in my city. I recently noticed I was overpaid and wanted some advice on how to handle it.

During my last pay period, I had to call in sick for an 8.5-hour shift. I left a 42-second voicemail notifying the center before it opened and before my shift started. Fast forward 20-30 days later, and I received my paycheck. I was expecting around $340, but instead, I got $540.

After reviewing my pay stub, I discovered that the center submitted pay for the shift I didn’t work. The issue wasn’t overlooked by payroll—it turns out the manager didn’t delete the shift from the system and still submitted it for payment.

I consider this a bit of a blessing, but I’m also realistic. If they notice the mistake and ask me to return the overpayment, I’m prepared to do so, and I have proof that I left the voicemail on the date I called in sick i'll just pretend i didn't notice it as that is most realistic thing as our pay stubs are tucked away in the system.

Since the mistake was caused by the manager submitting the shift, do you think it’s okay for me to keep the extra pay until they reach out? Or should I notify them first? i kindaaa wanna keep it!!

I hate that I ever cared about you. I hate that I fought so hard for a friendship you never even valued. I hate that even almost after a year of you ghosting me I still cry myself to bed almost every night and think about you. 

I hate that you sent me the message ""If that's what you need then I understand. I will try to catch up with you later"" when I said I wanted a break. That is the moment I knew this friendship was a lie to you. That I was nothing my love and effort had no value. All the abuse I went through with my parents who did not allow for us to be friends was for nothing. I went through so much for someone who doesn't give a shit about me for nothing and I wish I got every second of it back. 

I hate that you strung me along, I hate that you pretended to care, I hate that you threw me away and never treated me the same way you treated your other friends. With love and effort. 

I hate that I wasted so much time trying to understand why I wasn't good enough for you when the truth is you are a coward. Instead of telling the truth, instead of being honest about your feelings, you chose to breadcrumb me ghost me, to make me feel like I didn't deserve basic things in a friendship like remembering my birthday or even messaging/calling me first. 

And for what? So you wouldn't feel guilty? So you could walk away clean, while I sit here drowning in all the words you never said? 

You were not a good friend to me. I don't care how kind and wonderful you are to everyone else. To me you were avoidant, selfish, and emotionally empty. 

I hope you realize you had someone who cared about you more than you deserved and you threw me away like I was nothing. In fact I was nothing and I was stupid enough to believe your lies. I hope you feel even a fraction of the pain you caused me. 

I am done. This is the last time I waste words on you. I can't wait for the day where I don't remember you where I forget you where you are nothing to me like I am nothing to you.

Ayaw nilang makinig sa mga ideas ng Pilipino kasi dapat sila lang ay may ideas. Masyado daw silang advance dun compared dito eh kung titignan naman products ng students nila parang pang high school yung graduate school nila.

Napaka condescending din nila. Sa tanda ko eh, parang 7 year old ako kausapin. Every end of the sentence eh may do you understand?

Also, ang hilig nila magshare or magkwento tungkol sa current events sa Pinas na para bang wala akong access sa information. Like tunog ng tunig messenger dahil sa kakashare nila and with commentary ng panlalait nila sa intellect ng mga andito. Pilipino din naman sila.

At saka magtatanong sila pero ioomit nila mostly ng sinabi mo kasi meron silang gustong answer. Ayaw din nila maniwala sa sinasabi ko. Halimbawa, sabi ng relative ko, ano shoe size ko. Sabi ko 8 but if you plan to send a package with shoes, I dont think it's a practical idea because the cost of shipping is expensive. The money that you will use to buy the contents and the shipping fee can be sent instead and we'll buy here plus use the remaining money to pay the bills and buy rice. Also, most goods in the US are also available here. Ayaw talaga. Sabi mas maganda daw nasa US. Ang masama pa, kahit sinabi ko na size 8, binigay sakit eh size 6 kasi impossible naman daw na maging size 8 ako eh babaeng Pilipino ako. Di sayang lang kasi puro size 6 na sapatos laman. Nung binenta ko online, wala namang bibili ng orig price, ang nabawi ko lang ata ay 1/8 ng actual cost of everything. Kung sana sinend niya yung cash, nakabili ako ng fit talaga na comfortablr and yung cash na yun is maraming important na pinaggamitan.

Akala ko pwede ako maging honest sa kanila kasi diba ganun mga north americans lalo na mga taga US. Di naman bastos pero dinansabi ko pang opinyon ko. Halimbawa, sabi ko confortable na ako sa pagiging catholic kasi honestly, natritrigger sa mga setting ng protestant gatherings social anxiety ko (no offense po ah.). Minasama banaman. Arrogant and atheist daw ako. Porket intellectual daw ako. Sabi ko di naman po ako intellectual. Gusto ko lang maging honest kasi akala ko close tayo.

Parang ayaw din nilang pakinggan if you are doing well kasi gusto nila forever sila may tinutulungan. Pero ayaw ba nila nung feeling na yung tinulungan nila is okay na?

Só que depois que iniciei a minha vida sexual eu comecei a aprender várias coisas, mas ele não tem me agradado muito, no sexo o prazer vai todo pra ele, ele simplesmente faz, goza e acabou, ele não se importa comigo, se eu quero gozar, se foi legal, ele só faz o trabalho dele pra se satisfazer e acabou e isso tem me deixado muito mal e muito frustada, já conversei sobre isso uma vez ele se importou algumas vezes (poucas) com meu orgasmo mas depois a peteca caiu e voltamos a estaca zero, e isso tem me machucado demais pois ele age como se fosse a coisa mais normal do mundo. Esse ano ele me pediu em casamento e eu fico na dúvida se realmente devo casar com alguém que não satisfaz os meus desejos sexuais, porém não queria trocar alguém que faz de tudo por mim, o que eu faço?

offmychest,1ie68va,"""Money is the root of all evil""","This is my first post ever so I'm sorry if it's long or hard to follow, and there's a little backstory that I need to get out of the way first.

I live with my mom and recently we got into a rather large argument, and in a way it boiled down to money and my desire to move out. To preface this, my dad died back in 2021 due to cancer, he wasn't a good person by any means but his behavior towards my mom and I is what pushed us to be super close. Trauma bonding I guess. Six months after he died or so my mom started dating this guy, we'll call him Jimmy; And I started dating my boyfriend. She had moved in her mother at the time as well and I'd begun to notice a change in my own mom's behavior; She'd start getting irritated with me over little things, demand I do things for her (which of course I wouldn't mind doing regardless), and just all around not behaving like the mom I always saw growing up. 

About four months into her dating her boyfriend she kicked her mother out of the house and disappeared that same day, she'd moved in with her boyfriend and never told me so I just.. Waited at home for days and days, not knowing when she'd be home. I will admit losing my mom like that on an emotional level left a huge hole in my heart, and I'm ashamed to say my mind went down a dark path; But I'm proud enough to say I never acted on any thoughts I had then. I'd say maybe a year or a little less into her disappearance I had gotten her permission to sell my dad's old truck to try and get a more reliable vehicle, which she'd agreed to; But when it came time to sell the truck she dragged me out on a car ride to berate me over the money, telling me that she needed it for her credit card then said I was the reason why it was maxed out. The card in question had been used for groceries when we all lived together, and she'd also used it to buy things my grandmother had wanted while she lived with us. The argument had gotten so bad at the end of the day I had called the crisis hotline because I was afraid of what a dark place I'd gone to. 

Fast forward to last weekend my mom has since moved back with me into her own house for a little over two months now, and we finally had a 'talk' about what had happened almost three years ago. Come to find out she'd left the house to move in with Jimmy because she felt like I didn't need her anymore, and was angry that I wouldn't tell her ""until the last minute"" as she puts it, whenever my boyfriend or my friend would come over to hang out. She never voiced these feelings to me at the time and instead acted cold, angry or bitter when I did speak to her, or really seemed to care less when I'd tell her we had company. In a way it was an eye-opening conversation; I feel bad that she felt that way but I'm also angry she never talked to me about it; More than that I'm frustrated because it feels like I'm not allowed to have a life outside of her.

Now- On to the title. A couple of days ago we sold my dad's old boat (finally) for around 3k, we had agreed for weeks to use this money to buy a truck since we have a small farm, and need something to haul the trailers around. Well of course on the way to the bank with the money she made a comment to me about ""it would be nice to have that money to pay off my credit card"". Yep, she maxed it out again. I'll admit I didn't say anything for a while, because well, I didn't know what to say. I really wasn't in the mood to argue with her but I did say ""why don't we just hold on to it for a little while?"" to which she responded with ""Well that's fine.. I guess I'm not allowed to have anything"".

In the end it devolved into an argument like I'd feared, truthfully it was more of a shouting match. After I'd initially told her I wasn't comfortable giving her the money I felt like I was being guilt-tripped and just didn't want it anymore, I tried to give it to her and she started saying ""no I don't want it"", and when I asked her ""well why did you ask for it then?"" she would just say she didn't know. At some point she yelled at me saying ""Well you get everything that you want and I get jack shit"", saying how she never got any money from when my dad died, or my grandmother, or my grandfather. She shouted at me saying ""I took care of all those motherfuckers and I didn't get shit! I take care of everyone and I get nothing in return!"" and then started rattling off different things she'd paid for that benefitted me over the last few years; Things I never asked for her to pay for. I will admit she helped me out when I was looking for a new job after I had lost mine and paid my car payment, and I'm grateful for that-- Hell I'm grateful for everything she's done but now I just feel like a piece of shit. 

The more we argued the worse it got of course, she even used the fact that I was contemplating an attempt at you-know-what after she left against me, saying I was ""out to make her the bad guy"". 

Of course I've confided in my boyfriend and as angry as he is and as upset as I am we've both agreed it's best to just grin and bear it until I'm able to move out. We're talking about getting engaged soon and getting our own house, but I feel like I can't even be excited for that knowing how my mom is and her attitude towards my boyfriend and the idea of me moving out typically goes over with her. I feel trapped. I try hard to be a good daughter for her and to work, and do what I can. I don't know where I went wrong or what I've done. I know she's done a lot for me and I used to love her so much. I feel like a piece of shit because I can't tell if I even care enough to say I like her right now.

I'm dreading the thought of her looking at wedding dresses with me one day, or sitting in my wedding, or being there when we have kids. I still haven't gotten around to telling her we were shopping for engagement rings because I'm afraid she'll ruin that too.

This all started over some stupid money, and she wont even take that from me now. I don't understand why everything has to be so money centered with her. I understand what it's like to lose money, hell I've had people take advantage of me too I get it but, sometimes we have to live and let live, work hard and make it back. I don't understand why that's so hard for her to do, or why she seems to take it out on me.  
  
I don't know what to do anymore, I can't confide in her anymore obviously since she'll just use it against me. I don't want to burden my boyfriend with this either, he already doesn't like her as is (I don't blame him). I just feel so trapped and so alone.

offmychest,1ie9nt8,Feel like I made a mistake,"I just broke things off with this girl I was talking to. Weve been talking for awhile bc she had some home things to figure out and her mental health along with it. She made some dumb mistakes that involved me and after I was willing to talk through everything with her and see where we should take it. Then we started talking about it and she said she wanted to then out of no where she just stopped responding, she is someone who has to sit and think of a response when it’s a deep question but not days. 

So after two weeks of no response we agreed to talk. She apologized for everything and how she treated me and just saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship right now and stuff. But she would go on about how great I am and stuff so I asked her if she was 100% okay with just like losing all that bc she’s not ready and she said she just wants time to think about it. I was ready after the 2 weeks to just send some messages and be done but I thought maybe we could give it another shot and try harder. But lately Ive been feeling like I just want to be alone, I want to be there for her and to help her with her issues like her parents possibly splitting up and she has some habits she wants to quit and other mental health stuff and I want to help her really bad but I feel I can’t stay her friend bc it would hurt me to see her with someone else. It kinda feels selfish for me to say that like almost like I feel I have an obligation to help everyone bc I feel I have been blessed in my life and it’s not fair other people aren’t. She said she really wanted to be friends with me but I just said I can’t. 

When I think about more things I just keep feeling a lot of her actions didn’t match what she was saying, I’m sure it wasn’t out of harm but just to watch someone say they care about you then ignore you. She barely tried to fix the last thing and we barley talk anyways and she’s not even allowed to hang out with me. I just don’t get if she thinks I’m so great to and for her why she would be ok with just throwing it away. After about another 2 weeks of letting her think about it I just told her I don’t Think it’s gonna work and all this other stuff. Just saying that her actions don’t align and stuff and I can’t be her friend. She said she understood and stuff but I just feel guilty cause i worry about her. She has made some suicidal remarks before not out of like manipulation like some do but while she was telling me about stuff and she’s only mentioned it once. Like I said I worry about her and feel like I should be there for her and feel like I’m just leaving her in the dust with her problems and no one to help. I feel

offmychest,1idyjfk,The gender wars are making me lose faith in my friedship,"This is a throwaway. 

Greetings. I'm a 17y/o M and the gender wars are making my friendship miserable. For context, my best friend is 17F. Before you ask, no we do not like each other romantically, we never had, and we don't have a plan of ever going out or being together, despite the pressure from everyone around us. 

I'd also like to say that in this age of extreme polarisation it's genuinely hard not to generalise any group, yet I try. I try so hard to think of everyone as a complex individual and not group them together with ""others of their kind"". But anywhere I go, almost everyone I know, is generalising some certain group. Whether that be immigrants, or muslims, Indians, jews, women, homeless people, you name it. 

By best friend is not an exception. She is particularly.. Misandrist. I'm not using this as a buzzword, she fits the definition of a misandrist. But I often ask her what about me, if all men are monsters and potential rapists and killers, does she feel safe around me? She does. I'm different for some reason. I'm not a normal man, as she puts it. She also has this take that men and women can't be friends because one will always destroy the friendship by falling in love or just sexually harassing the other one, and anytime I ask her about our friendship she either laughs and changes the topic, suggests that I may be of different sexual preference, or just brings up the fact that I'm a high functioning autist with a lower emotional intelligence therefore I wouldn't even be capable of doing something like this. 

I can't stand it anymore. We haven't talked about this topic for a few months now, but each day I'm slowly losing faith in this friendship, to the point that I don't even know if it'll last another year or so. I like being her friend so much, except for this little detail, that is becoming a bigger and bigger dealbreaker. I don't know what should I do. I can't talk to her about it, because tbh I don't have a good enough response to anything that she says, because she's clearly willing to contradict herself as long as she keeps believing this. I also don't want to cut her off, but I don't know if I want to continue either. I just wanted to get this off my chest, any advice is welcome but is not necessary.",7,2025-01-30 22:48:43,16,0.67,Intelligent-Sky-1824

Putting in some spacing is the least folks can do, to make it easier so that us reading your posts don’t have an aneurism and can actually absorb the info. It’s a far better form of long form text communication when you break the text up a bit. 

Ideally, essay style, should be adopted. Not because it’s what schools teach but it’s genuinely helpful to get the reader to absorb what you write.

But if you don’t know how to write an essay, just add some spaces between clusters of sentences… oh, and please for the love of all that is merciful, write actual sentences.

offmychest,1ie97nv,I do not think my best friend’s boyfriend is good for her,"I just needed to rant about something that has been bothering me for a while. My best friend,who has been my rock,my angel sent from heaven,my sister in every way that isnt blood related,has recently gotten into a relationship. 

I was the one to introduce them together (I love playing wing woman) and for months I was so excited for her to experience her first real love and relationship. I was their biggest supporter. I thought he was a respectful,kind,passionate hard working guy. The perfect man for her. They have so much in common and they talked long distance for months!! 

Recently at the beginning of the month,my friend came to visit me and I was so happy to spend girl time together. I had a whole weekend planned for activities and things we loved doing together. Now this is where things become problematic. 

My bestie’s boyfriend messaged her saying that since he was going to be in my region he’s going to pop by and see her. I was taken aback because they had plans to see each other the week after but no matter. I could easily adapt to whatever was necessary. 

We only got information on where he was in the late evening,we were about 20 minutes away from my home. We had to rush back in the dark,in an unfamiliar territory for my other friend to drive in. I was a little bit anxious about having a man that I didn’t know all that well in my home but if my best friend trusts him,I was ready to be a great hostess.

He shows up at the door,greets all of us but for the rest of the evening,he didn’t try to participate in group activities (we played music,did karaoke,other stuff that us girlies love to do) he cleaned out all of my beer and the one time he spoke to me during the evening when I tried to get him involved,he was so curt and rude I felt so embarrassed. 

It was clear that he didn’t want to make an effort and it was clear he only wanted to spend time with my bestie. It just hurt a lot because I felt that my best friend was more reserved and nervous to be herself and it broke my heart. 

The evening eventually comes to an end and it is clear he is not leaving so I took the pull out couch for him to sleep on. But it was clear he wanted my best friend to sleep on the couch with him which wasn’t the original plan but I let it slide. 

The day after,I come home from my shift to find that they slept until noon and my other best friend had to be quiet as a mouse and had to essentially hide in the room instead of having a girl’s morning. The dude still helped clean up and do the dishes,which was nice. 

However,there was this lingering feeling of him judging me and my other friend for talking  and holding conversation,even though we tried to include him in it. 

When it is time to go home,he insisted that my best friend goes back with him in his car. The original plan was my two best friends carpool together back home. I was taken aback because one,my other best friend had to drive alone on unfamiliar roads,and two,my best friend was in a car with someone who was essentially a stranger to me and hadn’t exhibited the best behavior. 
Even when I said to him “Take care of her,bring her home safe.” He looked at me with a mocking glare that made me feel so uncomfortable. 


It’s so clear that my best friend is in love. I am so happy for her to experience that. However it is her first relationship. I’m afraid she will lose herself in this guy who seems to like to do things on his terms. She has one of the most beautiful souls ever and she is in the honeymoon stage!! But I have played these games before,I lost myself and it took me months to pick up the pieces. And I see it all happening again to someone I love dearly. 

I’m posting this just to vent because I am confrontational but also very blunt which could lead to horrible misunderstandings (WHOOHOO autism). I’m just worried sick. She’s already not that active with messaging our friend group and it takes days for her to respond…it’s all what I did with my first relationship. I want it to work out but a part of me still is extremely wary. 

Maybe I’m just being paranoid about everything or extremely dramatic. Idk it’s just something I had to get off my chest (lmao title mentioned) ",1,2025-01-31 08:04:13,0,1.0,Kitchen-Jackfruit704
offmychest,1ie95r9,Ive had a rough night,"about a year and a half ago my therapist told me ""you cant threaten people"" and it still makes me really mad sometimes because it makes me feel like a bad person sometimes, because in 2023, after my ex broke up with me after 5 weeks and 6 days, after taking my virginity and being attached at the hip, I got mad at her like 12 days later, and then she blocked me and started ignoring me in public. After that, i started feelin like k\*lling my ex sometimes. I started getting really fuckin mad. So one night I messaged a mutual friend saying ""she shoudl start c\*tting herself a little deeper lol"" and admitted that i felt like punching her in the face sometimes, even though i knew i shouldnt, because i was really fuckin mad. So when my therapist says that it makes me feel like a bad person because i did do it, and that just causes me to feel extreme anger towards my therapist. And then earlier my mom came in and talked to me about it and then eventually i left the room because i was upset, and I guess it made me feel like a bad person as well that she didnt try to keep talking about it. Made me feel like I was ""too much,"" or bad I guess. idk. So now ive been mad at her for the last like 5 hours. idk ",1,2025-01-31 08:00:44,1,1.0,MacThaGOAT
offmychest,1ie8xjh,ADHD Meds and Trauma messed my life up forever,"   In 2017, 11-year-old me was diagnosed with ADD and got prescribed a new (at the time) medication known now as Adenzys XR-ODT. Coincidentally at the same time, was the beginning of a nasty, nasty divorce between my parents. Dealing with this new concept of divorce, vicious bullying in a small catholic school, verbal abuse from my father, and having no friends at the time put a huge strain on my mental health. I started to build my own shelter, living in auto pilot. I used the medication to block out my emotions, which began to cause serious damage down the line. 

Today, I have lost most of my individuality. I lost my unique writing style, my love for designing and building items, my love for cars. All through the gradual course of time. I feel like a void. I have an amazing, supportive girlfriend who has really been with me through everything, but I know I worry her. The pain of just being absent all the time makes me try my hardest to be whatever I was. But to be honest, I forget who I was. All she sees are the glimpses of when I come back to myself and crack some jokes or talk about the old Chevy Monte Carlo SS that just drove by or maybe a long-gone memory that involves a mutual friend from our old school. It pains me to break her heart, but I know she sees the true me and I'll forever love her for that and try my best. At the end of the day, I have no control over this bullshit, and I just try to be the best version of myself and to take everything one day at a time.

Take this as a warning to be careful with the types of stimulants you take. I know they work for most people but there's always the exception, especially with outside factors involved. Thanks for reading and   
take care.

offmychest,1idkuro,How to fuck your kids up 101,"I remember when I was 11-12 my parents telling me that because I had gained some weight that “no one will love if you look like that” and I assumed that they wanted me to look like my younger sister who’s several inches taller, blond, has an athletic looking body and good at everything she tried. I saw none of the things my parents apparently desired in myself and what I heard was “ because you don’t look like your sister no will ever love you” and because I would never look like her I just assumed I was doomed to die alone. Fast forward 10 years and I still can’t shake that. I hate the way I looks and my mom heard me saying some very disparaging things about myself and she said “ don’t say that your beautiful” and i really sat there a while thinking, that’s not what you said 10 years ago so you must be lying to me now. So much of my childhood was comparing myself to a standard I could not physically meet. I always thought my sister could do things better than I could and when I asked my mom what I could do better she only had  1 thing to tell me “ you give better hugs” which means nothing in a family that doesn’t like physically contact.

He lives at home with his mom and he’s not scrounging for pennies, he happily spends £100’s on figures, Pokémon, presents I just don’t understand??

We dated from November 2023-march 2024. While we were dating he told me he loved me, he said he saw a future with me, said “I’m in it for the long run”. Then he left me for his girl best friend. In one of his comments on a Reddit post he described me as a “short lived rebound”. Back in October-November 2024. He started texting me again after my town was destroyed by hurricane Helene and I had to move back home for a couple weeks. He told me all this stuff about how I was “a whole lot of woman” and he was scared to commit to me. He had broken up with girl bsf and told me how terrible and abusive she was and how much he hated her. I stupidly believed this and started talking to him again. Eventually, I had to go back to college but we kept texting. Then he went to the psych ward for a weekend after a suicide attempt. I had cried on the phone to him begging him not to kill himself. Then he stopped talking to me. Eventually after I badgered him enough he told me he got back with his girl bsf because “she was the only one that cared about him”. Even tho I embarrassed myself so many times telling him how much I loved him and begging him not to kill himself. I hate him so much but at the same time I crave him, I need him more than anything. At some points I was so low I considered offing myself and taking him with me. I really don’t know what to do or how to even try and get him to get back with me. He’s so fucking in love with girl bsf even tho she’s cheating on him and treats him horribly. ",4,2025-01-30 23:49:14,5,1.0,EnvironmentalTear851
offmychest,1idvm11,Sex with wife isn't my best,"I've been married to a wonderful woman for a few years now and we get along great, have dates occasionally, have discussions instead of fights, compliment each other and so on;really a very fulfilling marriage in almost all regards except sex.

On average we have sex maybe once per week or two. I admit that neither of us are very sexual so usually it's fine but I know on her side it's because she is self conscious about her body because she used to be overweight as a child/teen but has since lost it. Unfortunately this means that her body isn't as ""perky"" and never will be due to the loose skin. I still think she's extremely beautiful and I tell her in the bedroom too but I can tell it affects her sex drive and performance.

This has been weighing on my mind and recently and I realized that the past few months I haven't been enjoying our sex as much so I tried to remember when it started to be like that. Unfortunately it also got me thinking about past partners and I realized how much I miss the feeling of pure passion without any inhibitions. This is a hard blow for me because I love with all my heart, though now I think about the past sometimes and it eats at me and I could never tell her about this as it would just make her feel worse. One thing that helped in our early relationship was either drinking or smoking to remove the inhibitions but we've moved past the drugs and are trying to be responsible in our adult lives. 

tl;dr - Sex hasn't been great recently with wife because she's self conscious about her body and now I'm missing past partners where this wasn't an issue. ",7,2025-01-30 20:45:33,8,0.77,Fancy-Syllabub-2124
offmychest,1ie4lez,The girl I love disappeared,"I didn’t know how else to phrase the title so it might be a bit of a stretch. 

But I’ve been friends with this girl, ‘Naomi’ since grade 4. We’ve been together since and in grade 7, we started going out. We were on and off thanks to some school drama but we always came back together. She changed schools around grade 10 but we kept in touch. Now, I’m 20 and I haven’t spoken to her in a year or two. 

Believe me, I’ve tried to contact her. But every time I look her up anywhere, she doesn’t show up. Her Facebook is gone, so is her Instagram. The last time we spoke, it was after she disappeared for 6 months. Apparently it was her now ex boyfriend who didn’t let her talk to me because we were dating once. From what I know, she isn’t with him anymore because he was abusive. 

I really want to get back in touch. I still love her so much but I want to be her friend before anything. Her disappearance from everything made me really worried but I haven’t seen her name on any missing list or death documents. I’m sure she’s just out there, living her best life, but I miss her so much. 

I just really need to talk about this before my heart exploded. It eats me up inside and I just want to go back to my school days to relive those times. ",2,2025-01-31 03:29:58,2,1.0,_Omurice_
offmychest,1ie8ik5,i feel like my bf spends more time with his friend than me,"hi my bf(19) and i(20) just hit the 2 year mark not too long ago and tbh i think this situation im going to explain happens occasionally.

so this is my second year at college this is his first, we haven’t really seen each other like how we did before college(would be 4x a week max) now it’s only maybe once a week if we plan it. i get that we are busy with school and i work so yes i understand schedules can get busy. he has one close friend (from what i know) and ofc i want my bf to be social and do things with his friends i fully support that. 

so like how i mentioned earlier my bf has this situation happen occasionally, it’s where he hangs out with this one friend and plans things with him and can spend time with him for a lot longer than me. recently he has seen him 3x this past week, one more in the next couple days and i haven’t seen him for two weeks. i mentioned to my bf that why does he see his friend more than me, he says he doesn’t get to see him often (which is a lie they hang out quiet often). this has happened in the past where he just hangs out with this friend and will give himself excuses as to why he can’t/hasn’t seen/planned anything with me. 

i already told him in the past i would like to see him more and i get that it’s a busy time right now but when he’s hanging out with his friend more than me it’s just hurtful. 

also whenever we do hang out it’s… kind of boring recently. we don’t really do much, we either go out to eat and he just takes me back home(sometimes hangs out a little before we go out) or we just stay at my house either to have sex or to try to do something to get out. he usually hangs out with me for 3 hours max and says he has to go home (we both still live with our parents) and i try to do like couple activities like go to the movies, mini golf, pool, etc but he just isn’t that interested in doing it with me. like we haven’t gone to the movies as a date because he just doesn’t want to but will go with his group of friends. maybe its a different experience with his friends but it’s just odd to me i guess.

when it comes to dates or hanging out i usually initiate it or encourage him to plan a date for us (meaning i tell him we should go out and if he agrees i tell him he should plan it as i feel like it would be more fun for him).


overall i’m just kind of disappointed as before he said he will try to do better in the future and hasn’t really shown me that. maybe i’m just overthinking it i don’t know really. he always says he’s tired and stressed (his answer as to why he doesn’t plan much with me) so i feel bad but angry at the same time as he can go out with his friend more than me.

just looking for advice or input

Or maybe it's when the rejection starts to hit.

When you first start liking someone and you guys talk all day, everyday. They say goodnight, they say goodmorning. 

Then you notice they aren't saying goodnight.
Then you notice they aren't really talking much.
They aren't responding much.

offmychest,1ie881i,I hate myself,"I destroy everything I touch. I’m a porn and sex addict. I’m on my second marriage about to be my second divorce.  I love this woman more than anything and I don’t know why I have such an unhealthy relationship with sex. I cheated sporadically for 3 years. With about 5 different women.  I knew I didn’t want to do these things and I kept doing it.  I needed the validation to stop all the negative feelings and the constant nagging in my ear  that ***I** (accidentally put she) wasn’t good enough. She’d whisper in my ear that she loved me during sex and the other ear was telling me I don’t deserve her. And this was after what I did.  She’s been trying very hard to fix this marriage and she’s been very mad and resentful towards me. She has gotten help and she was genuinely doing better but I became so anxious that I deserved for her to leave especially after everything.   
Last week we were communicating and we were trying to build new habits. We started marriage counseling finally. But she broke up with me in between every session and then would ask me to come back. And say she wants to work on this. And then the focus woild be on that each session but then we finally had one where we talked and things looked better. We got in a fight on Thursday last week and I couldn’t give her space. I became passive aggressive. When I finally came around and apologized she ended it. She drove an hour to our counseling appointment just to tell me again.  I deserve this. I hurt her. I hate myself. But I’m going to become someone i don’t hate.

offmychest,1ie83jx,I just feel so trapped,"A couple years ago around 2020 lockdown my mum and I found out that my dad cheated on her with supposedly his ex who he never mentioned before marriage. I was 13(f) then and was in my first year of highschool and also have a younger sister who just started primary school then(5yrs). He was having an emotional affair with her and would constantly be out of the house talking on the phone with her away from his family but even still my parents decided to stay together and my dad ""SWORE"" to never so it again. My little sister was also born a couple years later. Howver even when my sister was born he still kept cheating and even went overseas to see her and went to a hotel with her and took her out using the excuse that he needed to see his dad and that he was sick leaving my sister's and me with my mum alone. He also sent her flowers and money every year on her birthday. When he came back he denied everything but Fast forward to now we found out that he started cheating again and talking to her and we kicked him out of the house. My mums pretty attached to him so she started crying and begging him to come back home to which he refused and starting blaming her for everything saying she 'crossed the line' cause she told everyone including his family about his affair. Eventually he had to come back because my mum lost her job and needed him to support us again. I'm in my final year of highschool and have graduated now, but my mum relies on me SO MUCH for emotional support and to take care of my siblings and the house work yo the point she can't handle it if I'm gone for more than a day. Ik she doesn't have anyone else to go to but she's become a bit emotionally unstable over the years because of my dad, and she uses my and my siblings as a way to keep him at home cause she's scared he will run away to his mistress again. My siblings also rely on my so much especially my 3yr old sister who ive pretty much parented till now. At this point I'm forced to do uni here eventhough I wanted to go to a different uni and pursue medicine which my mum wont let me go to which was my dream☹️. It would also have meant I wouldn't be living at home anymore eventhough I would only be living an hour away by car. Since I was little I've always wanted to live by myself and have that uni experience but I can't. I feel like my dad's already ruined my teenage years and even still I can't even live out my university years how I want. I always imagine what life would be like if he hadn't done what he did, considering I dealt with a lot of mental health issues during highschool like depression and OCD which I never actually got any counseling for cause between my parents drama I didn't have time to tell anyone. This just caused me to pile on weight cause I just couldn't look after myself cause of my mental health and my parents situation and now I have health issues. Honestly I just feel like I'll forever be trapped here dealing with my parents especially my dad's bullshit. And I'll just spend myife being a maid for them and babysitting my sister's. Considering I do a lot of work around the house on a daily basis includong chores as well as changing my sisters diaper, i also put her to sleep, feed her and change her clothes, aka most of the stuff my paremts should be doing not me😕. And when she crys she runs to me and I'm usually the one who has to calm her down. Ik they need me and it may seem selfish but I'm so tired rn and so emotionally and mentally drained and I wanna finally be able to live for myself for once not be a caretaker for my siblings or a therapist for my parents. I just feel like I'll never be able to be free.

offmychest,1idvvez,I Can’t Stay Here Anymore – I Need to Leave,"I've finally reached my breaking point. My dad has been an alcoholic for over 20 years, and my mom—who left him because of it—ended up becoming just as bad, maybe even worse. When she’s drunk, she’s mean to me in ways that cut deep. My dad, on the other hand, just keeps drinking, no matter how many times I’ve begged, pleaded, and cried for him to stop.

At the start of 2025, he swore he was done. He said 45 was the year he’d turn his life around. I really thought he meant it this time. I counted the days, and when I thought he was 30 days sober, I found out he started drinking again on day 22. His excuse? “It takes 22 days to break a habit.” And just like that, he was back to passing out on the floor every night.

For a second, I thought I could stick it out—save up, plan my future, and leave when I was financially stable. But I can’t do this anymore. I can’t keep walking past my dad on the floor every single night. I can’t stay with my mom, because she treats me like garbage.

So, I’ve decided. I’m going to run away. I’m applying for jobs, looking for anything decent enough to live on. Once I have something, I’ll move out—probably overnight, since I don’t have much to pack. My boyfriend and I will figure something out, but I need to leave before this breaks me completely.

I love my dad, but I can’t keep living like this. I never got the childhood I deserved, and now I don’t even get a stable start in life. One day, I’ll probably find him the same way I do every night—except he won’t wake up. And I can’t be here to see that happen.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just need to let it out. Maybe I need advice. Maybe I just don’t want to feel so alone.

offmychest,1ie3q9z,Vent about a former friend.,"NOTE: There is some NSFW stuff in here, so please keep that in mind before reading. 

So I had a friend - Let's call him James. I met James in 8th grade, and since then we've really had a pretty on and off friendship. We've gone weeks, months, and even years without talking but then we'd always land up to become friends again somehow..  When we were around 16, I was comfortable enough to introduce my mother to him, and even though she said he seems fine, I always had a feeling she didn't really like James or she got a bad vibe from him. I asked her what she thought about him and she said *''Meh, he's alright I guess''* which in my mom's language means she doesn't like him. Me and James have had some arguments, hence me saying that we had a sort of on and off friendship. But nonetheless up until this point we stayed friends. By the time we were 19, we were great friends and hadn't gotten into a friendship-altering argument in a while. We knew exactly what the other person would do in a situation. Or at least we thought we did. I say this because one time we were watching a movie in the Cinema, and I saw a cute guy. I didn't tell James because I knew that if I did, he would get his ass off his seat, go to the guy, point at me, and say *''My friend here thinks you're cute. Would you like her number?''* And I told him about this later saying I didn't tell him during the movie because knew he'd do that exact thing, and he chuckled and said *''You know me too well''.*  So you see, we really were good friends - and no, nothing more. He's made it clear many times that he thought I was average looking and that I'm just not really his type - and I was perfectly fine with that. He wasn't my type either. I saw him as a good pal. And I was so sure that he saw me the same way.

This one time. he was comfortable enough to give me condoms once *(the story is long, he bought condoms but it turned out he couldn't use them, so he gave them to me. I can't explain this too much but this was how comfortable we were in our friendship. We were 18 at the time.)*   I should probably note that until then he's made some comments about my body I found odd, like saying that I have big boobs and stuff like that. Most of the comments were back in 8th grade, so I silently forgave him.   

Once, about 6 months ago, he asked me if I knew any women around our age who wanted her \*\*\*\*\* eaten. Now, this didn't bother me that much, because we were close friends.(There's a reason I'm bringing it up though. Because he later judges me for ''overly sexual'' dressing but I found it hypocritical.)

The issues arose when one time, we went to see fireworks together, and we met up about an hour before seeing them.

The first thing he said, wasn't *''Hi, how are you''* or *''Nice to see you again''*, it was  *''What's with the get-up?''* I didn't know what that meant, so I said *''what do you mean?''* and he almost annoyingly said *''What are you wearing? It's so weird.''* And I'm like *''How?''* And then he said *''It's so revealing. Why are you showing your legs like that? You should cover up more.''* I didn't appreciate this. I wasn't even wearing anything crazy. It was a mid length skirt with boxers underneath. I ignored it and figured it was perhaps a one off thing, but he brought it up again after a couple hours once we were done seeing the fireworks. What he said that pissed me off even more was *''I prefer modesty''.* Now, the fact that someone would have this opinion isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is

A) I know that the *''I prefer modesty''* statement isn't even true at all. It seems like he only prefers modesty on ME. He's a sexual minded person who asked me if I know someone our age ish who wanted her \*\*\*\*\* eaten. That's not too modest of him, but he's judging me?

B) He doesn't need to be commenting on my clothes like that. even If he DOES \*''prefers modesty''\* and prefers to cover up, he can do that.

It was really almost like he was trying to persuade me NOT to dress how I did.

Even though I really did not appreciate what he said, I tried to brush it off and ignore it.

But the next time we went to hang out? Same thing. I was wearing long pants, a jacket and a med-length tank top. It was nothing you don't see people wearing every day, I assure you that. He said *''Why are you dressed so weird? Well, AT LEAST it's not as bad as last time.''* and I told him he doesn't need to worry about it so much, and he said *''I'm not trying to be weird, but it's just so difficult not to stare.''* At this point I'm getting pretty annoyed with his comments, because he's said it at least 3 times now. It's like he can't shut up about it. I then say that I don't like his comments to him and he's like *''I'm just saying my opinion I think it's too revealing!''*

Next month, September, James messages me saying *''Hey, I have a question.''* And I'm like *''What's up?''* He then sent me this post he had seen and been interested *(funnily enough, it was actually from this site)* from a couple looking to exchange partners and/or have a foursome, but they'll only do it if he brings a girl.  
I immediately responded saying that I wasn't interested, and I asked him why he asked this all of a sudden. He then sent me the DMS of the conversation with the couple, which was fine, but you know what ***else*** he sent? Their nudes. A photo of the guy busting a nut the woman cumming, and more NSFW photos of this couple that I DID NOT ask to see.

Now, I happened to open this message in the middle of class not knowing what I was about to open, so I was worried that if anyone at my college saw me open that I would have been in trouble. So, after that I just turned my phone off instead of replying.

Later that day I put my phone back on and see like 50+ messages from James, and he's STILL asking me if I was interested in the foursome and asking me why I stopped answering him. I told him once again, that I wasn't interested and that I already said that, and after that I stopped replying to him because I was so mad. I thought he was my friend, but all this time he saw me as what? A fuck buddy? I never wanted anything sexual with him and I made that clear in the past, and the thing is, he's made it clear too that he didn't want anything sexual with me either, so I guess he changed his mind suddenly?

I eventually blocked him and told him not to talk to me again, he still tried to contact me and insisted I *''hear him out''*, but I refused to. I don't know if me refusing to hear him out was me being too rigid or mad, or if I genuinely just was so done with him. I told im I will not hear him out and that he should not contact me again, and this time I meant it. and I vented to my mom about it without saying who it was, but she somehow figured out it was James anyways because she somehow knew what type of person he was. Her motherly instinct knew something.

I personally think I made the right decision to block him, because I can't be friends with someone who's constantly picking on my choice of clothing and sends me unsolicited photos after I make it clear I'm not interested. I just feel it was so wrong of him to be so pervy about what I was wearing and try to tell me it's wrong to dress a certain way. But a part of me wonders if I had done a dickish thing by blocking him without hearing him out or giving him another chance. My mother agrees that I did the right thing, but what do you think? I would like to hear a non-biased opinion. Feel free to ask any questions or ask for clarity for anything. And give your honest opinions or anything please.

offmychest,1ie0q1j,"As a Pakistani, I wish I was East Asian","I know it sounds racist and bigoted but that is unfortunately how I have been feeling since 2020. There are tons of reasons I wish I was east Asian, so many that I don't think I can list them all here, but I think the main reason is that they seem much more appreciated. With things like anime and Kpop and Kdramas becoming more popular and mainstream in the west, I can't help but notice how people seem to idolize them, even if they don't outright say or imply it. I don't know how to explain it, but all the people praising Korean skincare, Korean dramas, Korean pop music, Japanese anime, etc, it just really makes me wish that things from south Asia were treated the same but instead we are mocked. 

Not only that, but as a south Asian woman in particular, I just feel like we are seen as less attractive than east Asian women. All the time, I see the most mid white guys put these pretty east Asian women on a pedestal while south Asian women are  not even paid attention to, and when we are, it's mostly to make fun of us. There are also more positive stereotypes attached to being east Asian than being south Asian. For instance, east Asians are generally stereotyped as smart and well behaved, while south Asians are just seen as these dirty people with no regard for hygiene or other people's space (that ""bobs and vagene"" meme comes to mind). 

I also feel sad about how east Asian countries are generally developed while the south Asian countries are lagging far behind them in comparison. I know that's because we were colonized by the British while east Asian countries kept foreign influence out of their countries, but I kinda feel like we brought it upon ourselves by being too consumed by religious and cultural differences while east Asian countries (like Japan) were more united in terms of their cultural and religious values. 

Speaking of that, I personally feel that south Asia puts way too much importance on one's religious background to the point where they don't focus on real issues, like bettering the quality of life for everyone. No, instead they are too busy arguing amongst themselves while east Asian countries are quickly advancing and becoming prosperous. For example, China came out with an AI (deepseek) that rivals ChatGPT, while Pakistan is too busy with its dumb military coups and political corruption to even think about anything else. I don't know, I just think it's so sad how we were once the earliest civilizations (Mohenjodaro) and now we're being left behind in the dust by east Asia. Does any other south Asian feel the same way sometimes?

offmychest,1ie2qiv,my ex is stalking my best friend and I'm taking matters into my own hands,"I apologize for the rambling my blood is boiling and yes this is a throwaway

As it says in the title, I 18f and my best friend 19f have been friends since our sophmore year of highschool- i had moved to a new state midway into the school year and she was my history partner and from there well the rest is in stone.

Our junior year my ex(19m) asked me out and we started dating which was quite possibly the worst mistake of my life- he was cold and emotionally manipulative and corced me into sexual things- one of those times was definitely not consensual and I ended up pregnant because of it- right after i caught him cheating we broke up in a classic teen drama shout out on campus- and then his sidechick began to bully me and exposed the fact i was preggos

  Obviously I aborted, and he ignored me for most of the remaining school year until our senior year where at that point i had moved on and healed enough that summer to be with my now bf of almost 2 years.

He repeatedly acted overly jealous and would show up to my house unannounced and approach me in public despite my clear uncomfortableness- now fast forward to now the prick fucking stalked my best friend's sandbox acc and has been forcing his way into her home by sweet talking her parents (They DO NOT know anything that happened, if they did they would definitely not be okay with him pulling up)

Worst part he stole her ring- and sent us pics of him sporting it on his finger. Now I never went public with what he did to me, i was scared and stupid- but because I never spoke up I now have not only this shit but more things I could expose him for to his recruiter and his parents. I'm planning on calling him and threatening him with not only legal action from both me and my friend if he continues but also letting every person he knows what a shit stain of a person he is- unlike him I dont give a flying fuck about my reputation.

I've been nice and keeping quiet but this was my final straw- he can fuck me over as much as he wants but being an obsessive freak over other women is where I draw the line",2,2025-01-31 01:58:43,0,1.0,ReplacementFit3567

offmychest,1iec0t0,Why tf is porn legal?,"Raging porn addict here🙋🏻‍♂️trying to better myself and stop tugging the pork sword, but it’s hard. 

For context - I’ve suffered with addiction all my life, had a bad addiction to codeine and tramadol in my early teens, popping 10-15 codeines a day and about 8 tramadols, all stolen from my friend’s mother - we were all on them and she didn’t need them. 

That turned into a cannabis addiction, which then spiralled into a cocaine addiction - yes I was shocked to find cannabis IS in fact a gateway drug. 

I shook the pills, I shook the coke, I still smoke weed cos it helps me cope with the countless problems in my head which probably stem from the drugs, but out of all of those issues, the longest standing vice in my life is porn. It’s so fucked. I made it 4 days this week, ruined it today(iykyk) AT WORK of all places. THAT is a lack of self control. I hate the part of me that craves dopamine.

 Porn is a terrible drug, with an even shorter buzz than any drug I’ve ever sampled which is a fuck ton. It shouldn’t be legal. I don’t care how old you are, porn is bad for you. They criminalise cocaine, heroin, crack, meth, MDMA because they’re bad for you, yet I could put all those down and I can’t get my cock out of my god damn hand. I can’t even call it capitalism cos I haven’t paid for porn in like 10 years, it’s just a fucking vortex to desensitise our minds. Any tips on how to stop bashing the bishop would be greatly appreciated. Can’t believe I just bussed a nut in a work toilet 10 minutes after an obese middle aged man dropped a huge shit in the same room. What a freak.

offmychest,1ie2lhn,So sick of job hopping...,"Hey all, 
I've (21F) been working since I was 14 or 15 (starting at fast food). Began retail at 16/17. I currently work at a pharmacy (front end) 40 hrs/we.Id like to say, my job is NOT hard. I'm a keyholder and this position is not rocket science to me. Most days fly by.
Ive had multiple jobs that I've either given up on going to or quit because I got bored and began feeling like a cog in the wheel with the repetitive nature of them all making me kind of depressed.
I know what you may be thinking (as it has been told to me before) ""normal people work 40 hours a week because they need to... XYZ! Suck it up! It's a paycheck! You're being lazy, just like all your generation. Expecting to make money for nothing!"" Etc.
That's just not the case. I love to work, but somehow or another things get too ""easy"" and repetitive, and I begin to feel as if I need to begin doing something with my life... because it just becomes the same thing over and over.
My coworkers (all mainly middle aged-60s) seem extremely content working here, and multiple have been here over 6+ years... but for some reason I find myself longing to do something better (for me) with my life, but worried that I will be stuck in the retail cycle forever. 
You cannot have an a million dollar dream with a minimum wage work ethic, but I simply do not know what to do anymore.

Just had to get it off my chest.
Feel free to leave any comments or advice if any :) 

Thank you!!

I wanna love waking up in the morning. I wanna love myself. But I can't, I can't stand looking at myself, at my body. I try to be happy bit I just....can't.

offmychest,1ie6mto,I felt human again for a moment,"I was recently ghosted by someone who I thought really connected with me. She pushed and pushed to hang out and at first I was swearing off everything but she really wanted me. ME. We met up and hit it off. She asked me to stay the night but I asked her to come with me to my place. We got close and slept holding each other all night. We kissed and hugged. The next day she told me she was thinking about me and that she missed me. Everything pointed to us meaning more. To me meaning more…and the next day she was gone. I tried reaching out several times through text before finally calling but she never came. She’s out there….but she’s not here anymore. She exists…but I don’t to her now.

It hurts so bad even though it was a brief moment in my life. I wanted to hold it forever…but forever never came. 

It felt so amazing and I can’t tell you how many years have passed since I felt that loved and wanted. It felt like none of my faults mattered in those hours. I had tried to kill those desires to want more just days before she reached out. And out of the blue she came for me. She chose me. Through all the hurt and pain…I felt human again. 

I’m back to the hard reality now. It’s like seeing a fireworks go off in the night sky. You wait for next one before you realize it’s not coming. But it was so beautiful…even if it was just a moment.",1,2025-01-31 05:20:17,0,0.99,avm2

Always the cold shoulder, the arrogant tone. The ""I'm better than everyone simply because I've been here the longest"" even though shit... You did less work than the new kid we hired last year.

offmychest,1idywdb,I don’t feel anything,"
19M. Recently I’ve been kind of confused at the way I feel, or more specifically, the way I don’t. I understand what emotions are, I understand body language. I just don’t feel anything.

I have friends, after speaking to them about why they talk to me or consider me a friend, they told me I’m nice. I’d never considered myself to be nice, I’d never really thought about it.

I thought for a while I might have ASD, I’ve crossed boundaries several times by going through people’s phones and belongings when they are not looking or around. I don’t feel guilty for doing it, I don’t feel anything for doing it.

The only emotions I feel are anger, temporary satisfaction and confusion. I don’t get sad, when my aunt, grandma, and other relatives passed away, I didn’t feel sad.

It’s only been recently I’ve started to feel this confusion. I’ve always been aware that I’m different but it’s only recently I’ve started to feel that disconnect between me and normal folk.

Reuploading. Just wanted to add that I think the reason I really started to notice this was because I recently lost my virginity to a girl who apparently has a thing for me. I didn’t think much of it myself but after, she accused me of leading her on, which for me is practically impossible. I asked the next girl I was with if she thought I was being cold with her, she said yes but that she didn’t care.",3,2025-01-30 23:04:06,1,1.0,None

offmychest,1ie1sws,Topamax has kinda ruined my life and I'm devestated,"I keep reading about the medicine Topamax on the migraine subreddit and it always triggers strong negative feelings in me. Because it's only after I've stopped using it, that I've realized what it's done to me and that even after all this time I'm still not me again. I took it from 2020 to 2022 (for about 2.5 years), but was prescribed it for something else at the time, not for my migraines. I recently saw the psychiatrist who prescribed it for me back then. And I felt a lot of anger and sadness, but I swallowed it and didn't let it show. 

Covid started a month after I got the prescription, so I didn't get any follow-up visits. I developed a bad anxiety disorder and depression in the meantime and only left the house about 10 times until 2022. Something that could also be related to the medication, but doctors only say that it cannot be changed now. I should stop questioning the past and concentrate on the present. It's hard. Furthermore, I lost a lot of weight within a year and was immediately put back into the “anorexia” pigeonhole, although an ed was not to blame. 

I'm 25 and have missed out on a large part of my life due to mental health problems. Meanwhile, I also have a lot of physical problems that fit perfectly into the Topamax side effect scheme and aren't getting much better. I sleep 10-12 hours every day and am always incredibly tired. My gastrointestinal system is going crazy, I was diagnosed with celiac disease 2 years ago, but something is still not right. Daily headaches and vision problems. My concentration jumps between everything and nothing, I can hardly manage to watch a whole movie in one go. And I feel stupid. Topamax has made me stupid. My memory is crumbling, and I was once one of the best students in my class. Although I've improved in the last few months, I still have memory lapses. I can't remember words and sentences, I can't express myself well. I try 110% at everything I do to be like I used to be (or at least seem like I used to be) but it's tiring. I would like to go to university next fall, but I'm afraid. This all makes me so damn sad and incredibly angry.

I don't know what else is connected to it, so often I'm told it's my mental health issues, but that doesn't feel right.",2,2025-01-31 01:13:43,0,1.0,marysaccount

i miss him so much, i loved him with my whole heart and i will never get over him. giving me advice at this point is useless. i will never heal from him, i think about him everyday and i hate myself for it. he hurt me, i should move on, i can do better but i still love him and it’s difficult for me to stop loving. i love in strange and obsessive ways, i’ll do anything to talk to him, to be close to him, to make sure he feels my presence . my biggest fear is that he’ll forget me, so i do everything i can to remind him of my existence . and i don’t think i’ll ever change even if im hurting myself more

offmychest,1ie63c1,What Eyes May See: A Short Story,"Yesterday was the first time we were forced to be in the same room together in over 9 months. 

I got to the cafeteria first and chose to sit at the second lunch table, facing the door so that I would see you and you would be able to see me when you came into the room. 

I figured it might make it easier for you to sit far away from me if I decided to sit at the middle table, in an place where someone walking down the hallway towards this room could easily see me from a distance. 

I stand up behind my seat, in direct line of sight to the open door. 

I try to make it appear as though I’m looking at the coworker who has decided to take the seat directly in front of me; but I’m actually staring right past him. 
I watch several people walk slowly down the hallway towards the cafeteria. 
The coworker in front of me and I start making small talk. 

And then I see you.

I watch you walking swiftly down the hallway towards the cafeteria. 

Quickly, I avert my eyes and continue making small talk with the coworker sitting directly across the table from me. 

After what felt like a few minutes, I decide to look towards the hallway again. 

You’re gone. 

I shift my eyes quickly around the room, surveying the area around me to possibly see where you may have gone. 

You aren’t in the room. 

You’re gone. 

But how…? 
How did you do that? 
Did you become an actual magician in the 9 months since we’ve last “seen” one another? 

But then I notice it. 
The bathroom doors on the right side of the hallway are open. 
There’s no way that you…  
You didn’t…

You had to have seen me and then ducked into the bathroom. 
For a second, I feel guilty. 

You didn’t know I was going to be at this meeting. 
To be fair, I didn’t know I was going to be in this meeting either. 
Until about 30 minutes ago. 

But I knew you were going to be in this meeting because I saw your name on the list two days ago. 

Unfortunately, my name wasn’t included in any of the paperwork for this meeting since it had all been typed up while I was out on forced leave from work by HR; they hadn’t included me in any of the prep for this because they didn’t know when or if I would return. 

This is a total shock to you. 
And for that, I’m so sorry. 
I’m sorry you received no warning that this was going to happen. 
You had absolutely no idea.

I’m starting to think that your reaction upon realizing what was happening may have actually been quite similar to mine upon hearing that I was to report to the cafeteria meeting location.

That’s partially why I arrived to the meeting so early: I knew you were going to be here.
The delay in finding out where I was to report for this meeting had actually served as a notice ahead of time for me in a way. 
I had already had my “public” freak out about this happening when I got the email with directions on where I should report in my car during lunch. 

I hate admitting that this thought made me feel a bit better. 
It’s comforting to know that perhaps I’m not the only one overwhelmed by this situation in which we’ve found ourselves. 

You come out of the bathroom and put your bag on the table next to the wall. 
I look at the coworker in front of me. 
Then I look back at you. 

You’re on your computer, still at the table in the hallway. 
Maybe you’re trying to check the paperwork.
Part of me thinks that you were so frazzled by this that you forgot that the paperwork for this had been given to us in our mailboxes… as a physical packet. 
It was never emailed to us. 

I sit down, still talking to the coworker in front of me. 

You slowly walk in. 
Almost immediately, you sit down at the first table, the one right by the door, which allows for an easy escape.
Good choice. 
Just as smart as you’ve ever been. 
Until…

I realize that while this has you sitting at different table from mine, it also happens to be directly across from me.  

To sit at that table correctly, you would have to directly face in my direction  and since I’m already facing towards the door—because you decided to sit there, I’m essentially forced into facing towards you. 
Something tells me you didn’t think through this all the way, my love…

Of all the places to sit…

Why?!

You sit down and immediately realize what you’ve done in choosing to sit there. 
As quickly as you sat down, you stand back up and swiftly walk out the door, leaving all of your stuff on the table.  

You walk quickly down the hallway away from the cafeteria. As you walk by someone, there’s an exchange of words that has you wildly waving your arms as you spin around on your heels and make a sharp turn to the right and out of sight. 

I’m speechless. 
I feel a knot forming in my stomach and a sudden but familiar wave of nausea. 
I consider quickly moving seats before you come back. 

Ultimately, I decide against it since I don’t want to risk making you panic more should you come back and suddenly not know where I am because I moved. 
At least if I stay sitting here, you already know where I am. 

After a few minutes, I see you walking back down the hallway towards the cafeteria.

You coolly walk in the cafeteria and sit back down in your seat. This time you straddle the bench and in doing so, you avoid facing me directly. 

You put your elbow on the table and your chin in your hand. Your other hand is twisting the facial hair on your cheek, one of your go to stimming behaviors. 

I want to tell you how sorry I am for this… how sorry I am for everything that happened between us… and how I’m still so completely in love with you. 

Your planning-partner for the meeting comes in. 
He sits at the table behind me. 
You don’t move. 

After several minutes, you grab a snack from your bag and quickly walk past me. 
Behind me, I hear your planning-partner thank you for the snack. 

I don’t turn around. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I watch as you quickly walk past me again, sitting back in your seat, straddling the bench like before. 

You never move to work with your partner during the meeting. 
He doesn’t move to work with you. 

You sit there, chin in your hand and fidget uncomfortably on the bench. 
I try hard not to watch you. 

The presenter starts talking. 

Every once in a while, I glance over at you. 
So far, I’ve gotten away with little peeks here and there. 


But then we make eye contact for the first time in over 9 months. 
I look at you. 
And the only reason you catch me looking at you is because you look at me. 

I think both of us died a little inside in that moment.
… I felt it. 

Throughout the meeting, I continue sneaking quick little glances at you. 

You got your ear pierced. 
That’s so cute. 
Not sure if it’s just one or both. 
Still, it’s cute. 

But then I slowly realize that something is off: you don’t quite look like… you. 

You look incredibly overwhelmed. 
Your facial hair is longer than normal (probably because you know that I absolutely hate facial hair), but it also appears wild and unkempt. 

Your eyes are red and slightly glassy. 
You look like you either had been crying or may be actively trying not to cry.

You don’t look as causally professional as you usually do. 
Sure, you’re dressed the part. 

But you look so exhausted. 
So weighed down. 
So weary. 

This is a noticeable difference compared to a couple weeks ago when we saw each other for the literal first time in over 9 months as I walked past you in the hallway and your turned your head so completely so that you wouldn’t have to look at me. 
I felt my heart break again in that moment. 
But…at least then you looked like you.

But you don’t look like you right now. 
You look as though you’ve been struggling. 
Your skin is paler than usual. 
You look so completely drained. 

Why?! 

Please don’t say that…

Is this the result of me finally returning after having been out for so long? 
Please don’t tell me that’s the case. 
There’s no way that I could have done this to you. 
It can’t be. 
I love you.
You didnt want me. 

Maybe you’ve just been super busy? 
Or maybe you stayed up too late the night before? 
A pit forms in my stomach as I start imagining you out late at night with faceless girls that aren’t me. 

I think we only made eye contact the one time. 
I’m not completely sure though because I completely disassociated. 

This has to be a dream. 
None of this feels real. 

You’ve always felt like such a dream. 
Sometimes it was hard for me to believe that someone so amazing could actually be real. 
I was obsessed with you. 
I told you that I was obsessed with you. 
And you were okay with it. 

You have your adorable hyper-fixations. But my hyper-fixation has always been you. 

But ever since you ended our relationship… friendship…  whatever the hell we were— just over 9 months ago and then I was forced to take a leave from work because my heart was completely shattered from losing you, my life has been a complete nightmare. 
The countless nights spent sobbing, willing with all my might for you to come back into my life, wishing on every visible star in the sky that you’d stop getting so completely lost in your head about the possibility of an us, that you’d  finally realize that you have feelings for me too, that you would come back and finally decide to be with me…
I was… am… so completely in love you. 
Still. 
Even after all this time. 

No contact. 
For 9 months. 
And yet, for some reason that I don’t even fully comprehend: I’m just as in love with you as I’ve ever been. 

Just like I was back when you were my best friend. 
Back when we said it was us against the world. 
Back when we said we’d always be there for each other. 
Back when you said that for some reason I see you. 
Back when you said that I was one of few people you weren’t afraid to be and could be yourself around. 
Back when we said always,
And I meant it with every fiber of my being. 

9 months later and I’m still completely and wholeheartedly devoted to you. 
It’s sad. 
I know. 
It’s so sad, but so true. 

It goes without saying that part of me wonders if you snuck glances at me too. 

When the meeting ends, people start to pack up and leave. 

You haphazardly pile up your papers and get your stuff together… you take a deep breath… and then don’t get up to leave…

Why?!

I start putting my stuff away in my bag. 
You sit there, staring straight ahead at nothing. 
A statue. 

I stand up and put my bag on my shoulder. 
You sit there, staring straight ahead at nothing. 
A statue. 

The coworker who sat in front of me at my table and I walk past you. 
He says something goofy and irrelevant. 
I laugh. 
You sit there, staring straight ahead at nothing. 
A statue. 

Said coworker and I walk out the door, still chatting. 
I don’t know what you did.

offmychest,1idbvp2,Reported my sister for child abuse,"In December my niece disclosed that her mother, my sister had physically assaulted her younger sibling. The disclosure was in person and she sobbed begging me to take them in, I told her that I can’t just take them and she asked for me to report it the relevant authority of our country.

This isn’t the first time my sister has physically abused the kids, she is constantly emotionally abusive and the abuse has gone on for 10+ years, but my family have just buried our heads in the sand.

The day of the disclosure I called and made a report, today I received a call from the police asking me to make a statement tomorrow to kick start their investigation.

I am now having regrets, not regrets about reporting but about the potential outcome. If my sister finds out it was me who reported her, she will punish me by not allowing me access to the kids which will in turn punish the children as I am their escape. If she doesn’t find out it was me who reported her, but find out the details of the abuse this will make it worse on the kids as she’ll believe that they reported her or have told someone.

The guilt is eating me alive and I’m so concerned that I have done more harm than good for those kids. 

I shouldn’t have said anything, I should have just grit my teeth and just kept trying my best to be their weekend escape.

I’m honestly kind of freaked out and I need some help making sense of this. I’ve been following the release of Spider-Man 2 and was really excited about the PC version. But here’s the thing—I distinctly remember playing the game before it was officially released.

I never owned a PS5 (still don’t), and my PC was struggling to run the game because it was a demanding new title, but I played it anyway. I remember fighting the Sandman, dealing with small versions of him, collecting crystals, and then battling Kraven’s crew on a ship. The next scenes were me chasing Kraven through his ruins, and it felt real—like I had actually played it.

But here’s the issue: the game didn’t come out on PC until recently, and I never had access to a PS5 to play it early. I’m not sure how to explain this, and I can’t shake the feeling that I really played it, even though I didn’t have the chance.

Could this be some kind of weird memory glitch, a Mandela Effect, or even a simulation error? Has anyone else experienced something like this, where you remember something that shouldn’t have happened yet?

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or insights. This is really throwing me off.

offmychest,1ie1bks,I dont know if i should tell him about the dream i had or if it doesnt matter,"ill cut to the chase. 
basically i had a dream about my boyfriend cheating on me. Ive never had those dream before until tonight. literally after day after my birthday i get it this weird dream and i wake y feeling weird. my boyfriend doesnt cheat whatsoever so im worried but also i hated that dream and its fucking with my head idk.

deats;
all i remember in the dream was chilling around like new york or something with a girl [A] and he friend [B] or something and then that girl disappeared so i was like ok weird but whatever? i end up walking back to my old place which i apparently just rented with the friend [B]. its was sort if a tike skip and then i had to go to my boyfriends house for something and everything is normal except that girl [A] is just there so im like uh okay.. i chill  fir a few minutes then i leave for some reason  and tip toe back down only to see him  and her [A] hard making out im like ????;?;?;!,’bvnvnvhxhdhge???!!!! so i make down the stairs and they separate quickly and im like “i literally saw you guys making out HARD core. you really thought i wouldn’t see that?” and he didnt even say anything or defend himself and the girl [A] was. under the fucking sheets like ok.. 

that was basically the dream. like i said he actually hates the concept of cheating and all that, and i know he wouldnt ever do that, because he has no problem just telling Google that he doesn’t like them anymore (In a respectful way obviously) but holy shit.",2,2025-01-31 00:51:02,0,1.0,voidicleX

I am really sensitive to everything and even the thought of leaving things even objects behind my life and forgetting about simple things, like a good movie i wanted to watch but couldn't. its like I think everything has feelings. Even a fictional  book where i kind, spiritual character is killed it makes me cry and depressed about it. The thought of an actual human, or friend is worse.

My life is a bit in turmoil, which is my fault. At least the end of turmoil maybe?, but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to be happy anymore. I barely get turned on anymore by attractive women. I use that as the first point because that’s supposed to be the easy one, but now it’s one of the most painful aspects of this part of life. Journaling doesn’t produce coherent thought, but typing this out here is the closest I can get.

Food has become a…discomfort. That being said, tonight, I made a nice-ish dinner with some steak on sale that tasted pretty good but I feel like didn’t bring me nearly as much joy as what I remember good meals bringing me. I tried being fun with spices, and maybe if I had anything fancier than cumin and garlic salt, but it was food enough still. That’s the other thing too, I barely remember things. All I remember are flashes when I used to remember exact snippets. I could see and hear things and now it’s just murk and tendrils and gaps of nothing.

I used to drink a lot and often, but now it’s just a lot and infrequently when I feel like I can’t hold out any longer and get shakes. I have one bottle left that I’m saving other than the end of the one I took a swig from tonight so at this point I’m even running out of what feels like the only thing I have to distract me away from my feelings. My family thinks I’m happy and that things are looking up, but I can’t admit to them that it’s difficult again, they take it worse every time. I fucked up and lost all of my close friends, guys I could talk to for the past couple years just don’t fucking answer when I reach out. I don’t know what kind of awful shit I said to them while I was deep drunk last time but I woke up to calls and text that scared the shit out of me and deleted it all still drunk and blocked everyone. But I can’t go back now. If things were that bad then it’s just done.

Driving sucks now and was the one thing that in my whole life brought me more joy than anything. Told someone today that if I could do whatever I want, I’d be like Stig and just drive drive drive so fast all day long around and around the track. Music is hand in hand there too. If I could ask for anything it would be just a couple good songs. The stuff I was given before just makes me so fucking sad because now it’s all negative connotation and I’m too weak and fucking crying to be able to get around that.

My family always told me I was the tough one or that I didn’t have any emotions and for some reason that was such an obvious thing but now I feel like all I have is sadness and I just need to let it out but no one wants to hear it from me.

offmychest,1ie4z2d,Feeling Lonely.,"I haven't felt this bad since high school. In high school, I was lonely. No friends. Read books. Chatted with the teachers instead when they politely conversed with me. 

In college, same kind of deal but I was able to socialize a lot at work. Until a teenager got a crush on me and I didn't reciprocate and he turned everyone against me. Except for the creepy coworker manager anyway. 

As an adult on her own, now, I find myself lonelier than ever. Somewhat recently I have found my faith in my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ. I will follow Him to the ends of the earth. But still, there is no physical company. I have a boyfriend, now, who I like a lot. I took off work to take care of him when he went to the emergency room just the other day. But coming over is too big of an ask because we have different sleep schedules and he would be bored...

It sucks. I work anywhere from 58 to 80 hours a week. I am so stressed out I am having physical symptoms. 

I'm trying to lean on Christ. It doesn't stop the physical pain in my chest, yet. I am still trying to achieve faith life rest.

offmychest,1ie4y1l,I’ve been having thoughts of killing my mom (tw for death and & and self-harm. all that fun stuff),"**added the tw just in case**

(just fyi I can’t get therapy or any kind of mental health treatment as we don’t have the money (or insurance) for it. Not to mention most of the therapists here are a religious therapist situation (as if pray to jesus and everything will go away). Like, I know I need it, it just simply isn’t an option. Even if it was I probably still wouldn’t ask.)

I feel like I just need to say it since it has been plaguing my thoughts sporadically and varying intensities. But to get one thing out of the way, no, I am not going to kill my mom. Never will.

But just god my head won’t shut up. I’ve had several moments where I will be in class (I’m 16M) and just have the world around me disappear but simultaneously be overwhelmingly loud. I can’t focus, people talking sounds like the volume of screaming, I get angry, I get filled with anxiety, and of course the thoughts. When it’s not killing my mom (which are mostly intrusive and pass by) it is my mom being dead.

Every time someone comes into the class who’s not a student, I panic thinking it’s someone coming to tell me my mom is dead. I get randomly scared that my mom got in a car crash and died or got hospitalized on her way home from dropping me off. And when my mom is out I fear she died. When I’m in my room and hear a sound I fear someone killed her or was in the house.

And sometimes I will just catch myself having vivid images in my head of me stabbing my mom and then killing myself after. Murder-suicide shit. That or it’s me killing her (or her just dying in general) and me fantasizing about fucking up my life.

Cutting myself to no end, being able to go out and be just some object to use, buying drugs and shit. I never let myself think about it for long, mostly due to fear and guilt, but sometimes it just lingers. I think about the betrayal in her eyes. The fear as she has her own son stab her. Idk. And sometimes I get disappointed that I can’t regularly be self-destructive. Or at least do it without guilt. Which that only makes me feel disgusting in all honesty.

These thoughts have just been showing up, sometimes they’re back to back and sometimes they take a while to show up again. But it has really kicked up after a recent emotional episode of mine where I did shit I would rather not talk about (it’s just embarrassing and self-destructive and gross. nothing like me just being a violent little shit or anything). 

It lasted about two-ish months and there was a long of random heightened emotions where I would panic or think that nothing could be real or that I was another person. The paranoia just followed, along with my OCD coming back real bad, which I also suspect this is all linked to. Idk.

And just, I dunno. I feel like the worst part about this is how aware I am. Aware of how stupid and nonsensical this all is. It’s all irrational shit but yet all the fun little emotions are there which fucking sucks. I mean, I’ve been dealing fine.

offmychest,1ie4xoh,Being Rich Sucks,"I want to start this story with something that’s stuck with me for a long time.

It all started with a friend. She had this massive mall and was really well off. We were eating at a restaurant, and she ordered this ridiculously expensive cake. It was covered in gold. Real gold. And I just sat there watching her.

She took out her phone, adjusted the angle, made sure the cake was in view, and snapped a selfie with me in the background. She was looking at me looking at herself through her screen, making sure the lighting was right, the framing was perfect.

And I sat there thinking: *Is this what it really means to be wealthy?*

To just… sit there, proving to everyone on Instagram that you can afford a gold-covered cake? A cake that tastes like an ordinary chocolate cake? That’s the whole point, right? Just to show people you could buy it.

And the worst part? I wanted to buy a gold covered cake too just so I wouldn’t feel like a failure.

I’ve always hated consumerism. Ever since I graduated in advertising and marketing, I saw through it. They teach you in marketing that people don’t buy expensive things because they need them. They buy them because exclusivity makes them feel special.

A $5,000 bag isn’t just a bag. It’s proof that *you* are worth $5,000. More than the regular person.

I saw it in my dad too. His gun collection. His Gucci bags. His sports car.

And the worst part? It never ends. No matter how rich you are, there’s always some weirdo who probably killed a bunch of people who’s richer than you.

Some people would tell me, *at least you grew up well off and stable.*

I’ve been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I had undiagnosed bipolar disorder, along with OCD. When I was a kid, I’d stand in the same spot for hours, touching the same object over and over. I’d make the sign of the cross 900 times every night, and if it didn’t feel right, I’d go up to 2,000. Then 3,000

Shit.

I was never taken to a psychiatrist. My mom refused. In her mind, if people found out, they’d think she was a failed parent. So to protect *her* image, I never got treated.

Growing up, there was always this sense of unhappiness in our family.

Maybe it was my dad snorting lines of cocaine every weekend.

Maybe it was my mom, who manipulated her way into marrying a rich man, hiding her mentally deranged, bipolar, narcissistic self until after the wedding.

Maybe it was the night we had to wrestle a gun out of my dad’s hands.He was high, completely out of his mind, waving his pistol at us, threatening to kill us all. After months of this, my siblings and I jumped him, fighting to get the gun away until the rehab guys showed up and dragged him off.

I sat in that rehab facility, supposed to be talking to a therapist, and the only thought in my head was

*At least we can afford the fees.*

Maybe that’s why people are obsessed with looking rich.

Because life fucking sucks.

You might be suicidal and have no reason to live. But at least you went to New York for the holidays And you had sex with a celebrity.  And that’s better than being poor and suicidal, right?

Fast forward three years. My dad got assassinated. Next to him my distraught mom who saw the entire thing unfold. He died In his big old car with his gucci bag and Probably enough blood in his hands that he could probably paint a whole building with.

I wasn’t really surprised. He had made a lot of enemies, and honestly? He wasn’t really that good of a person. And  for what so  we can tell his garbage friends about  how much money he  had. He ruined so many lives just because he fell for marketing. 

This is too dark Im gonna talk about something else so what was my best investment?

Not the fancy trips. Not the expensive shit.

I think the best thing I ever bought was a course from HealthyGamerGG.

(This isn’t sponsored or anything—it’s just one of the only things that actually helped me.)

One of the lessons was a meditation technique where you sit completely still. No moving. Not an inch. And the longer you do it, the more painful it gets. It becomes unbearable.

And then the instructor tells you: Focus on your breath.

Suddenly, that pain and suffering? It melts away.

Apparently, this is how monks and yogis discovered the nature of happiness. That happiness isn’t in the outside world  but in what you pay attention to.

You could be in the most uncomfortable position in the world, but if you focus on your breath, you can still find peace.

offmychest,1idpg83,"My bio dad hung up on me, and I think that’s the end of it","lost my dad last night—not in the physical sense, but in the way that whatever relationship we had is officially done. 

It all came to a head over something stupid, but that’s how these things go. A few weeks ago, he called me while he was in town. I missed it because I was out but called back within two hours. His voicemail was just, “Hey, in town, just calling to say hi,” and that was it. When I finally got through to him, he told me he was at a game and wished I was there—not inviting me, just letting me know he was there and that if I’d picked up two hours earlier, maybe I could’ve been. That’s just how he operates. I texted him later, saying something like, “Hey, you didn’t need to invite me while you were already there,” just pointing out how pointless it was to bring it up in that way. And then… silence. He barely spoke to me for two weeks, which is also par for the course.

When he finally called again, I brought it up, and he dismissed it immediately. Then he flipped out. Because that’s what he does. He wasn’t always like this but in recent years the littlest things make him flip.

I found out when I was 17 that the man I thought was my dad had adopted me. I reached out to my biological dad before I turned 18, and he was receptive. He knew about me but had never reached out. We built some kind of relationship—there were good moments, I met my younger siblings, but I was never fully integrated into his family. Everything was kept separate. His extended family didn’t even know I existed for about a decade. Some of that was because I moved far away, but mostly, he always had one foot in, one foot out.

For a long time, I thought we were close. But really, he controlled the level of closeness. It was always on his terms. Contacting a birth parent is riddled with many sad stories so I considered myself very fortunate a door wasn’t slammed in my face right away. 

Over time I came to realize the relationship centered around him. And for years, I went along with it, not setting boundaries, not wanting to rock the boat. I was naive to say the least and it took me a very long time to see these things.  

But lately, I’ve been working on myself, and naturally, that’s made things more tense. I’ve tried to create space, set healthier expectations. And like most people who thrive on control, he didn’t like that.

And all it took was another fake invite, me calling it out for what it was, and him blowing up. He said, “not to call him anymore?” and hung up. That was it. Nearly 20 years of this, and that’s how it ended.

I think people around me saw how problematic this relationship was, but that doesn’t make it suck any less. At the same time, I know this will create space for something better in my life—not necessarily a replacement dad, but just… not having this constant push-pull dynamic, this tension.

Still, I feel bad for him. He’s getting older and lonelier, doesn’t have many meaningful relationships, and is so used to just barking orders at my younger siblings. He’s a sad, man who lacks empathy and accountability. And I think that’s part of why he did this—out of guilt, shame, trying to convince himself he was doing the best he could when really, he was just checking boxes.

I reached out all those years ago to get to know my dad and I don’t regret that. But I’m glad I finally stood up for myself, even if it means closing this chapter for good.

I absolutely hate how limited it has made me. I'm young and got a lot to learn but I feel so hopeless knowing that I have been raised in a time where phones and other devices are so easily accessible that it has ruined me from an early age, with constant free dopamine, unworked for and I am undeserving of such easy to get kicks of momentary stimulation that makes me feel 'good'. I wonder how much better I would become if I was born in a time before this technology; a time where such forms of entertainment emerged AFTER I've matured and obtained valuable life skills and experiences. Now all it has done is limited me, and I always wonder how I could have turned out if it wasn't for this addictive drug. How much smarter I'd be, how much more aware I'd be, how much more experience I'd have. We always hear stories of adults' childhood, how they would travel around outside for miles on end, playing and socialising with others on daily basis, coming home not to a prison of unending dopamine but a normal life. A life where the mind learns from a young age many skills and overall maturity which can not be obtained in my generations and the ones to follow. Perhaps that can be obtained, but at such great difficulty. Something many before the vast emergence of technology took for granted, but which I yearn for. I feel limited and lost, as those older than me learnt so much more from life, and I, have got nothing but the achievement of being a prisoner to the violent revolution of technology.

He orchestrated the whole thing spreading false, wild rumors but making sure he only incited the abuse and left his fingerprints off it. 

The school administration was useless. No help. I left, moved far away. I missed all the reunions. 

Curiosity eventually took hold. After I found success. After I found confidence. The ""It Gets Better"" ads etched in my mind. It got better!! Where was he?

Dead. 

""A brief illness"" 

Didn't make middle age. 

I see the condolences. To his parents and siblings sorrow spoken. And here I am feeling confused. Upset. There would be no resolution. There would be no comeuppance. I have no satisfaction in his death. It looks so tragic from the outside while he created a path of pain in his wake. 

And being six years dead there's no relevant words. I am left wondering why it all feels so hollow. ",1,2025-01-31 03:04:30,2,1.0,Last_Translator1898

offmychest,1idw2od,I can't stop thinking about them,"I know I strayed. I know I shouldn't have been tempted. We both knew what we were doing was wrong. That it would hurt everyone else involved. I'm trying to repair the hurt I've caused you. I'm trying to improve the parts of me that caused this to happen, that allowed me to ignore boundaries, ignore better judgment. I've identified where I need to grow, the things I need to work on, the ways I can be a better partner, not just for you, but for anyone.

I love you so much. I want to continue down a path where we find happiness with each other. Where your smile makes me so fucking happy. Where holding you feels like the pieces fit just right. Just like that had for years. Where falling asleep next to you was something I anticipated.

I still feel those things but I've tainted them. They're all marred. They're all ruined. They're all marked with a touch of them. And I can't stop it.

It wasn't this way at first. When I told you I wanted to work on myself and I had no problem removing them from my life, I meant it. I didn't feel the attachment. I didn't feel the need. I just felt you and us and our future. I just wanted to continue loving you and being loved by you.

But time went on and they existed and their perception of me persisted. Our relationship incepted its way back into my mind like a thick oil covering everything. Slow at first, but the more it poured the less I could ignore it.

They were my friend before all of this happened. And maybe that wasn't true friendship. Maybe they wanted more from me than I could have given them at first. Maybe they wanted exactly what they got from me. Maybe they wanted more than what they got from me. Maybe I was just a prize for them to win.

Maybe they genuinely cared about me. Maybe they saw something I didn't. Maybe they saw something we didn't.

I can't rationalize the two thoughts. I simultaneously can't trust them yet I hang onto every memory as truth.

It has taken a toll on my mood. I can't think straight, I can't focus, I'm distracted. I feel like I'm lying to you whenever you ask. I guess I am. I'm not trying to go back to them and I'm not trying to fight for them. I'm not trying to defend either of our actions. I just can't stop the thoughts and it leaves me feeling nothing but anxiety.

Maybe all of this is just anxiety. With the way everything's been so fucked, maybe I'm just looking for something easier. And maybe that's all it is. Idealizing something I don't know because everything I do know is difficult right now. That's not your fault. I want to keep working. I've just become so despondent. And maybe that's just it. Maybe I'm just conflating my general despondency with a longing for something else. Instead of working I'm running. That's what started this mess in the first place.

Anyway, I will talk to you about this. I don't know when exactly but... soon. You've noticed I've been off and you deserve to know. Or maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe telling you this is just a selfish desire to find my own comfort. I never know, but it's starting to affect us both I think. I'm trying so hard to not let it eat at me every day the way it is by distracting the thoughts but that's just not working.

I miss you.

I miss them.

I miss us.

offmychest,1ie41ks,I Took My Survival for Granted,"This will be a bit of a rant, so thanks for reading it if you do.

By all accounts, I think I’ve lived a fairly healthy lifestyle, but it doesn’t feel that way most of the time. The more I think about it, the more anxious I get.

I was born with stage 4 neuroblastoma and have been in recovery since I was three. But the effects of chemotherapy are lasting, and it’s anxiety-inducing not always knowing how bad things were—or still are.

I have mild scoliosis, elevated to high blood pressure (average 130/80, often a bit higher, not terrible but obviously not great either), mild kidney damage, hearing loss, a missing adrenal gland, a removed left testicle, and missing adult teeth. Despite all this, I’ve played soccer, done fairly well in school and college, and maintained a relatively healthy diet. Compared to other survivors I’ve met, I’m incredibly lucky.

Still, the fear of death always lingers. I’m 25 now. I refused to wear hearing aids for most of my childhood and only started wearing them consistently a couple of years ago. I have high-frequency hearing loss—not terrible, but enough to give me a lisp. I also refused to take blood pressure medication when my levels started rising ten years ago. I’m finally taking it now, but it feels like I have to work even harder to control it. I worry it’s already affected my kidneys, though there’s no current sign of that (I also haven’t had a check-up in a while, like a couple of years. I plan to have it all checked out this year, and get back into yearly check ups).

I’m afraid that doom scrolling for the past decade, barely being active, and isolating myself—even though I do have a friend group—has damaged my mental and physical health. I’ve definitely overstimulated myself with Bryan Johnson’s videos, Blue Zone documentaries, and too many doctors who lacked bedside manners, along with reading way too much online. Now, I’m just worried all the time.

When I was younger, I barely exercised. I drank Pepsi constantly. I was always an outsider. I was—and still am—slightly addicted to porn. The fact that my blood pressure sometimes affects my erections, coupled with being a ""one-nut wonder,"" can feel emasculating. I wrestled for a bit and am fairly strong, but the fact that my heart is like this, that I don’t move much, and that I lack the discipline to stay consistent really drags me down.

I used to blame my parents for not being harder on me for not taking my health more seriously, but they did try and I barely listened. They are also living for the first time as well.

It’s a constant battle for consistency, almost like my mind finds comfort in self-pity and unhealthy habits. I guess we often cling to what poisons us, knowing it’ll destroy us down the road.

Looking back, my body feels weaker, my mental state more disoriented. I feel like I took my survival for granted. That I don’t truly appreciate what I have, and now I’m just ruining it. This massive mental block won’t let me move forward. I feel nihilistic, depressed—like no matter what I do, I’m just counting down the days.

I feel trauma in my body, and it makes me feel doomed. My awareness of mortality has always been heightened, but now I feel its full weight. Every time I’m reminded of one of my side effects or how I wasted my childhood glued to a screen, jacking off, and isolating myself, I feel dread.

Cancer survivors—including pediatric ones—seem to have a heightened sense of mortality, even if we don’t remember the experience itself. I feel it in my chemo side effects, in my body, like an aura that never leaves.

It can be easier to take it for granted because even if we feel that aura, its abstract. It is not an experience we had consciously. And even now it is difficult to really express.

Typing this out helps, but I don’t really know how to express it. And yes, I’ve been in therapy all my life because of other traumatic shit. My dad abused my mom and killed himself in jail when I was five. My stepdad has been around since then, so it’s not all bad, I guess, but still. I was constantly poked and prodded by doctors. Then, my senior year, my friend shot up the school and killed himself.

Therapy has helped some, but I’ve hit a wall. Eventually, talking about it doesn’t do much. It makes me over-analyze and overthink a bit. I have had great therapists but I think there is something more I need. I’m not diagnosed with anything, but I know I’m not depressed enough to be clinically diagnosed. It’s not *that* bad—I’ve met people who have it worse. I need action, not just words. A stronger push.

Getting fired from my last job because I let my mentality slip was a wake-up call. Now, I have time to look in the mirror more closely. But I feel hollow, unsure of my place in the world, and burdened by my own mortality. It leaves me in a depressive loop, drained of the energy to self-motivate. I’m doing better in my current job, but I’m constantly battling myself—and not always in healthy ways.

It feels paradoxical. I’ve led a relatively good life. I should be more grateful. I *can* do better. But I don’t. It’s like I need to start from scratch, completely reset my life. I don’t want to be a zombie anymore, numbing myself with social media and Netflix just to distract from reality.

Even though I’m 25, it feels like I have no time left. I know older people will say, *“You’re still SO young!”* And I get that—I still have a lot of mental growth ahead. But I also feel like I wasted the last ten years lost in screens, growing too comfortable with solitude, and now I just feel lonelier. I feel like I chose the wrong career, but I’m not sure where to go next.

I feel like a kid again, questioning everything. I’ve always been curious, but this time it’s different. Now, it feels like an urgent need to express myself—as a reaction to feeling like a waste. Like I could just die at any moment. Not the best way to start but it is a start perhaps?? lol

Life moves so fast that taking even a small step back feels like failure. Like I’m lagging behind everyone else. People say, *“Comparison is the thief of joy,”* but in this economy? How can you *not* compare yourself to others?

I’ve always liked the idea that Sisyphus was happy. Albert Camus said that—Sisyphus pushed his rock up the mountain only to watch it roll back down. And yet, he enjoyed the journey. He let go of his past suffering and found solace in the walk down to the valley. The thought is definitely a cope, but we all need to cling to something in order to not lose our minds lol.

Maybe I need to do the same. Even though I beat myself up all the time and feel like I won’t live a long life, maybe I can just take a step back. Find peace in walking down the valley, one step at a time.",1,2025-01-31 03:01:38,0,1.0,AlphoBudda

offmychest,1idyogg,Dodgy Boss,"I worked for a small, family-run business. It seemed like a good job up to a point; there were issues, sure, but there usually are in my experience. However, the owner of the company basically decided to dismiss a number of employees straight after their first performance reviews.

Now, in hindsight, there were likely multiple contributing factors, a big one being a decision to restructure the company and focus more on installation engineers, effectively downsizing the R&D and tech roles.

The issue I had was that this happened out of the blue, at the start of November. And as it was less than two years' employment, there was little in the way of employee rights. I believe, in hindsight, this has been a repetitive pattern of the company owner. The red flags should have been the fact that I was employed to review legacy code for ""boobytraps,"" and the management seemed constantly on edge regarding what the former tech employee may or may not have done. Generally, in hindsight, it speaks volumes about the manner in which the employee was left disgruntled. Now, after being dismissed, I realize the issue may have been the owner. His attitude was to not be forthcoming, and in meetings, he and management would discuss employees more like resources to be controlled, and their perspective managed (aka manipulated). It really was quite gross and exploitative. And when it came to ethics, it was often money first; the owner and his kin self-represented as holier than thou.

The company was quite shoddy, had severe cybersecurity vulnerabilities (e.g., ports left open), and generally, physical security was okay, but cyber was shot.

The software and hardware were an issue too, as I was a junior brought in to effectively do full-stack product development, which I actually did pretty well with. Yet the company directors were the owner's children; one had just changed career from a primary school teacher and was now a director for an engineering and manufacturing company, and literally did not have a clue beyond answering the phone lines and arranging team meetings. The other director was not actually working at the company; the boss's son was just a director on paper.

My line manager was the boss's daughter's husband, and the other manager, the boss's wife's (head of HR) best friend.

There were a few workshop lads who were cool, but ultimately, one of them got the boot at the same time as me.

The company were dropping the ball on a number of points: cybersecurity; I'm pretty sure they had some ghosts in their machines; health and safety violations; some minor human rights violations.

And in the end, while fighting the urge to go there in the middle of the night and superglue the doors and throw pink paint all over their workshop/factory/building, I decided to leave a bad Google review and Yell review. To my alarm and also weird gratification, the owner left a threatening voice message on my phone, saying he would call the police if I didn't remove the review. Okay, pretty sure the police don't do that, and nothing in the contract would allow for legal action. Moreover, I removed the review content anyway, leaving the one star, saying something like, ""I removed the review at the request of the owner,"" which still shows one star, which is fantastic, as it is their only review.

The owner managed to get my Yell review removed and wrote a slightly odd review under a fake name, stating they were a recent employee and how great the company is, which, yeah. I believe the review thing got under the owner's skin.

I received a random email subscription to the Church of Scientology today, which was funny, and I am 90% sure it was the owner or his son-in-law. I found it sort of funny and returned the favor by applying for the same tour on their behalf.

I have been continually tempted to seek some type of vengeance, and I have little recourse under UK employee law and, moreover, would be dragged through a long legal process for little to no gainful end.

Ultimately, me having a sour experience with a mean and manipulative boss, who is not shy to threaten, lie, and manipulate, just wanted to get out how angry I am and have been about this experience and the still-burning desire to utilize my creativity or ethical hacking experience to get under the guy's skin some more; but I really want to move on. I would say I have moved on, but it's two months later from November 2024, and here I am, still engaging with the anger and gameplay with the owner.

Time to move on, I think.",2,2025-01-30 22:54:52,0,1.0,Cute-Amount5868
offmychest,1idvg77,My mum failed me and my sister and I think she's weak,"

My 38f mother 63f got with my stepdad 64m  when I was 4. My sister 30f came along 4 years later. My stepdad comes from a dysfunctional background and his family- him included- drink heavily. Over the years he's gotten violent when drunk,  normally aimed at my mum but I've been in the firing line if he's seen my face in the room or because I've put myself between him and my mum. I've taken beatings for the woman and she took him back every single time. When my sister was 11 I was staying out one night and got a call from her asking if mum was with me. Turns out he'd been out with his brothers and came home gunning for a fight. The police collected me and I went home where my mum eventually turned up. During this incident he'd bitten my sister on her face! I thought mum would finally get rid considering social services investigated her! No, he pretended to put the work in and cut down on his drinking and he behaved mostly. A few arguments happened but no violence. There's been times when my mum had to flee to my house because he was starting and it got in the way of some of my relationships. Cut to Christmas Day. We'd had an amazing day but I had to leave because I was scheduled to work (I'm a nurse) and my youngest daughter stayed there while my eldest went home to care for the pets. My youngest rang me sobbing around 2am saying that they were arguing. My stomach dropped and in all honesty I almost lost control of my bowels because in that moment I felt helpless. My eldest went to pick her up in an uber and heard him calling my mum a name that related to me... I'm mixed race. 10 minutes after my daughters got home my ex got a call from my sister. Mum had called my sister for help and all hell broke loose. He attacked my sister, his own daughter, knocking her teeth out. The police came and arrested them both due to them both having injuries. My sister now has a criminal record. Mum allowed him to break his bail conditions by letting him back into the home. I really resent her. She's failed her kids and her grandkids, nothing has changed. He is safe and warm while my sister struggles to sleep and has flashbacks. She failed to protect us as children and she's failing to her grandchildren, my mums house is supposed to be a safe space. It's since come out that in the run up to Christmas he was drinking everyday. If I'd have known that we wouldn't have gone there. In the immediate aftermath my mum looked broken and weak and said she was done but not even a week later she welcomed him back. I hate how much of a coward my mum is, this has messed me and my sister up so much and I wouldn't be surprised if we both have PTSD from past and current events. Things I'd forgotten have come to the foreground of my thoughts, I'm having panic attacks and I'm not sleeping. I feel guilty that I wasn't there this time but I also feel guilty that I feel relieved. If it was me there it would have been me arrested and I'd have lost my job which I've worked so hard to get. I feel guilty that I want to leave my mum to sleep in the bed she's made and I feel guilty that my child is now withdrawn and missing her grandparents. I don't even have the energy to hate him properly it's all used up hating and resenting my mum for not leaving. She thinks me and sis aren't effected but I avoid relationships and my sister has abusive ones.

offmychest,1ie3fx5,Two teachers who ruined my brain got promotions and I feel like hitting someone.,"The following story might make me sound arrogant, but I’ll say this upfront: I may not be perfect, but I am smart. (Yes, I know that sounds corny, but please understand my frustration.)

For Context:

When I was in 11th grade, I was a math wizard. Math and chemistry were incredibly easy for me, though physics was a bit of a challenge. I was in the medical stream (CBSE board), so my subjects were Physics, Chemistry, Math, and Biology.

While PCM was manageable, biology was where I screwed up. Despite eventually earning a degree in biotechnology, I got a compartment in bio during 11th grade. That meant I had to retake the exam, pass, and then join 12th a month later than my peers.

In 12th grade, my school had a tradition of giving the top 10 math scorers a prize book. I was actually number one, but when my physics teacher came to hand out the prizes, my math teacher tried to stop him. She kept saying, “Why are you giving it to Marv? He’s a compartment child. Give it to Riya; she scored 40/40 in her unit test.” (I had scored 39/40 despite missing most classes.) The physics teacher finally snapped and said, “Ma’am, if you have a problem, get it signed by the dean. Don’t waste my time.”

My chemistry teacher, who was also my class teacher, seemed to have a personal vendetta against me. Despite my strong performance, I was forced into remedial classes simply because of my compartment status. These classes were supposed to help weak students, but I wasn’t weak in math or chemistry. Even in physics, I could outperform most of my class.

It wasn’t until the principal noticed me in these sessions and asked, “Why is he here?” that I was excused from all but biology remedials. Which, I’ll admit, I did need.

To make things worse, my chemistry teacher made us write 70 pages of NCERT (the standard book in India for CBSE Board Examinations) by hand for remedial classes—just copying, not solving anything. I refused to do that nonsense. Instead, I solved 70 pages’ worth of organic chemistry problems. He took it personally, tore up my notebook, and yelled,

“What is this nonsense?? Why didn’t you do it like I told you?”

If I hadn’t called my dad that day and gone to the principal’s office, I am sure he would have failed me on purpose and I would have to put up with his antics for the rest of the year while his personal vendetta against me runs rampant.

The irony is that these two teachers constantly preached about the power of education and how being educated makes you a better person. But in reality, they couldn’t see past marks or pass/fail labels. They never valued effort. Weirdly enough, the teacher whose subject I struggled with the most—my biology teacher—was the kindest and most humble of them all.

Now, coming to the title: my bio teacher has retired. My physics teacher is still teaching at my school. My chemistry teacher is now a principal at another school, where he even wrote an article about how teachers play a crucial role in shaping students’ development (yes, the same man who tried to hit me several times, and if I hadn’t ducked or protected myself, those hits would have done serious damage). And my math teacher is now on the regional education board.

The only person I’m truly grateful for is my principal. She protected me from the nonsense, called out my chemistry teacher for his “70-page copying bonanz” in front of everyone, and let me have the school year I deserved. She’s retired now, which is sad but inevitable.

It does infuriate me that people like the chemistry teacher and math teacher are actually advancing in their careers, why?!? You don’t even know your subjects, my guy you didn’t even know how salts burn in salt analysis. And my math teacher taught maths as if it was a language.

offmychest,1ie397a,Sleeping with dates too quickly,"TW: sexual assault 

I wrote this and thought I posted it but I think I accidentally deleted it (whoops) 

But tldr I sleep with the men I date too quickly and It makes me feel like shit

I (27f) have had a weird relationship with intimacy- I grew up never having a boyfriend, unsure of anyone actually had a crush on me, and not experiencing any sort love in that sense. I was raised conservatively (catholic) so I didn’t want to sleep with someone at least until I was in a committed relationship with someone.

Sadly when I was 18 I was sa’ed at a college party and it’s been something I’m working through. After I was with a few other people- and never in a healthy relationship, it was always a fwb situation, and the first boy who I truly liked never wanted to be anything more than that- I always felt like it was because I wasn’t attractive enough or that he didn’t want to be seen with me.

Fast forward to now and I’ve had three dates now where I slept with them on the first date- totally consensual, and this isn’t every date, so it’s not like a pattern in that sense. More context- both dates where after a long time of being celibate (3+ years and 1+ year). 

I guess more than anything I’m just upset in myself and lack of self control. I feel like men never want to actually date me, and when I have sex with them I can never been seen as a potential partner. I don’t know if it’s because I’m ugly or if they don’t like me. I try to be more patient and not sleep with some men, and it either puts them off or they make a big deal about it. I just am tired of being lusted after rather than loved and I know some people probably feel the same way. 

Sorry for complaining I just needed to articulate this. I am going through therapy for the earlier stuff so I’ll probably address this with  them too . ",1,2025-01-31 02:24:09,0,1.0,Sudden_Cranberry6869

Every time I try to talk to him tho, he freaks out, yells at me and tells me that I make my own problems and that I should just be grateful that I have a place to live and food to eat.
His girlfriend (now ex girlfriend) managed to convince him and I went to the first therapy session. It was hard but I was really looking forward to the next one, so we scheduled it.

When the day of the next session came, I got ready and asked my dad if he was ready to go. He then proceeds to tell me that he cancelled it and that I don't need it. I insisted that I wanted to go but he didn't let me.

Since that time, I never saw a therapist again. Things have been feeling really hard lately and I feel like I really need professional help, but I know my dad won't let me and won't pay for it.

offmychest,1ie2xlq,I don't know if im suppressing my emotions with my dads passing,"I just lost my dad over a month and he was my last living parent. I love him so much and i know that he knew that but I feel numb. I have been praying so i don't know if it is the holy spirit comforting me or because i was already kind of grieving him while he was in hospital (he was in a coma and before he was not himself because toxins were going to his brain) and the last time i properly cried was the day of his funeral. Everytime i cried after then felt like i was forcing it. I do get emotional when i see a place that reminds me of him and other times. Maybe this is because there was stupid family politics that made it hard for me to process his death. There was a whole bunch fo stuff that went down during the funeral week and it wasn't like that when my mother passed, so i feel like i sort of grieved her properly, there's no right way to grieve.

The most that I've felt is angry. I'm mad at him for dying. I'm sure that if you've experienced grief you get this, if not, please do not comment on that.

Is it maybe my brain trying to protect itself? I don't know...has any other Christian here had a similar experience with grief? Or anyone in general?",1,2025-01-31 02:08:15,0,1.0,thatonebeesh

And in my defense I feel like this is a pretty normal reaction when you stub your toe, but maybe that's just me not being raised right or something. I love her so much and this situation just reminds me that I feel like I don't get that love back.

At times, I would feel so much hatred and anger towards people that it turns into mania. These episodes of mania includes very extreme anger, hatred and I feel very depressed afterwards.

I don't feel depressed because of the mania, I feel depressed because I can't kill others without facing legal actions. Of course I do not just want to hurt random people, but rather people that I've typically known for a while and developed a hatred towards them.

I went to the doctors and after a few tests it was ruled out that my heart has developed arrhythmia from the stress and strain my mania causes me. It's so bad that at times I would go into a fetal position and my body would tense up in anger.

offmychest,1ie2kev,I sleep with them too early (tw: sa),"TW in second paragraph

 I’ve never done this before but I (27 F) have this issue (?) that when I go on dates with men I sleep with them usually on the first date. This has only happened two or three times- but it’s not something that I necessarily want to do(side note- it’s totally consensual from both ends but ideally  I want to wait to be intimate).

Little back story- before the few times this has happened I had gone a very long time with out being intimate with someone, 3+ years, and then 1+ year. I was raised conservatively and my first time wasn’t ideal- I was 18 and drunk so it was something against my will. Prior to that I wanted to wait until marriage, or at least my first boy friend, and I know that it wasn’t a healthy situation. 

Sometimes I feel like men will only like me if I have sex with them, and I didn’t really date anyone in high school or even college so I feel like I haven’t had a healthy relationship to compare. I don’t really consider myself to be the most attractive, I think I’m just average which I know is subjective, but I feel like even when I make men wait to be intimate they either stop talking to me completely or they get disinterested after. It always makes me feel worse because only feels like either they were just trying to sleep with me or I’m only good enough to sleep with and not good enough to date. 


More than anything just frustrated and upset with myself because It just happened again and while I don’t regret anything I just wish I had more self control. In my own values I don’t want to just be with anyone - my friends have never made me feel bad. Feeling like dating is really hard and just discouraging lately and dating app have been hell because I just feel like an object. It feels like men only lust after me and I just want to also be loved.

offmychest,1ie2etm,Payroll error - Company is overpaying me,"Im from CA and work 12 hour shifts with a 1hr lunch. My company recently switched to a new payroll system and since then me and other employees have noticed we’ve been getting an additional $150 each paycheck. When i looked at my check, i saw I was receiving a “meal penalty”. Under the CA labor law, for every missed meal break, the company would have to pay the employee 1 additional hour of pay for each workday a meal break is not provided. The thing is, I have been taking my lunches on time. This is an error on the payroll system. For whatever reason this new payroll system keeps marking my lunches as “missed” but on my time sheet, it does show that my 1hr lunch was punched. In addition, on my timesheet there is a line that says “California meal time” this is automatically approved. Its been a couple of months that I’ve been receiving extra pay and im starting to feel guilty. I dont believe my employer realizes they have been paying us thousands in violation fees. It doesn’t feel right to continue to allow this to happen. I feel dirty to accept money that was wrongfully given to me in error. 

I brought up my concern to my colleague and was automatically shut down. They stated that it is their mistake and we should pretend we don’t know anything. I argued that it was wrong but was told to stay quiet about it. 

Im really torn. I like my company  and they have treated me well. I want to come clean but dont want to ruin it for my other colleagues.

offmychest,1ie2bf5,"I Want a New Career and a New Country, but I’m Paralyzed by Uncertainty","I don’t even know how to start this, but here we go.

I’m in my mid-twenties, working in audit (sort of), and I don’t see a future here that I actually want. For context, I graduated with a finance degree, did well academically, but never really felt like I was good at it. I was okay, but not great.

I graduated right when COVID hit, spent about a year without a job, and then landed a role at an international firm in an audit-adjacent department. I never had a strong interest in learning more about my job, but I picked up what I needed to be competent. Over time, I was considered a good performer, got paid well (at least by my country’s standards), and even had the chance to travel and gain exposure to new opportunities.

But here’s the thing: I don’t want to do this anymore. I have zero interest in learning more or growing in this field. I recently reached a senior position, and it just reinforced the fact that if I were to move into actual audit instead of this back-office assurance work, I’d probably fail. I lack a lot of the necessary technical knowledge, but more importantly, I have no motivation to learn because I simply don’t care about it. I don’t enjoy the work itself, the conditions, or anything related to this career.

And this isn’t the first time I’ve tried to change course. I’ve jumped between ideas so much that I feel completely lost.

For example, once I realized I hated this field, I started learning German, thinking it could be my way out. After a year of formal courses, I reached a B1.2 level. But then I stopped. Why? Because I had no clear plan for what I’d actually do in Germany. I’ve visited a few times and would love to live there, but when I researched master’s programs, I found that most are consecutive (meaning they require a related bachelor’s degree). That means I’d have to stay in finance or accounting, which is a no-go.

At one point, I dabbled in low-code data analysis and BI tools, thinking I could pivot into that. But, like everything else, I lost motivation and dropped it. Now I’m stuck in this loop of wanting to leave my Middle Eastern country, having the financial means to do so, but not knowing what to do for work or what path to take.

Whenever I search for in-demand jobs in Germany, it’s always something physically demanding or nursing—neither of which I see myself doing. And for fields that actually interest me, I don’t know if I qualify or if they’re even worth pursuing.

And that’s another problem—everything I’m genuinely interested in, like philosophy and history, isn’t exactly lucrative. I don’t see how I could make a living out of them, especially in a new country where I’d already be at a disadvantage.

Do I go into data analysis? I don’t know—there’s way more to it than the small bit I learned. And even if I wanted to study it, I probably wouldn’t qualify for a master’s in it.
Do I stay in accounting? Hell no. Especially not in Germany, where I’d need to learn their accounting standards, which I have zero interest in.

I just don’t know what I want anymore, and I don’t know how to figure it out. I feel completely lost.",1,2025-01-31 01:38:11,0,1.0,Humble-Meeting2905

This is from 2023 March. I know it’s so old but it’s just what I did is coming to me now. 
I met a senior in my college. He was cute, he was adorable and he wasn’t conventionally handsome , but I found him very charismatic

We started talking, and this was when I was going through a bit of a talking to multiple men phase. I had a situationship I was hooking up with , I was on dating apps and I started talking to this senior. 

He is friends with my current bf, and my bf knows about him. Everything there is it to know , including what I did and how much I hated being that person because inherently I am a lover girl. 

Anyway, in March 2023, we started talking and we got close very quickly. We used to go on walks regularly for a month from 12am to 3-4am. We had moments, but nothing major happened. 

The thing is, he wanted to be serious, and I didn’t want to be serious with anyone at that time. I told him that but he still wanted to try, and he almost changed my mind. Almost. It’s just, something was missing and that something my current bf had. And I started hooking up w my current bf while I was still with this senior (my bf and the senior both know this) 

I started lying, and I was then asked to choose ntween current bf and the senior. I chose the current bf and that , acc to his friends and him, hurt him a lot because he tried a lot for me. 

I still feel horrible about it. I have gone through rigorous therapy, I have apologised to both bf and senior about this, and I have tried and still trying to be a better version of myself. I made a mistake and I feel horrible about it, because I keep meeting the senior since him and bf are in same group and it’s obvious that he hasn’t fully moved on, and his friends have told me the same thing. 

I have apologised and maintained my distance to him and his friends, telling my bf I won’t come to certain plans because of senior. Bf understands why I am guilty about this, and I want to clarify that I have NO feelings for senior and no remorse about choosing bf over senior. I would choose my bf over and over.

I wonder if you knew, in that moment, what you were choosing. If you paused to think about the silence that would follow, about the way I'd walk away and never look back. Or maybe you didn't think about it at all. Maybe it felt like nothing at the time—just a sudden decision, something easy to brush off.

But for me, it wasn't sudden. It wasn't easy. It was the moment everything changed.

I gave you so much. I gave you the version of me that believed in you, that thought we were on the same side. And yet, you made a choice that said otherwise. A choice that told me exactly where I stood, even if you didn't say it out loud.

So now, here we are—or rather, here I am—because your choice drew a line, and I stepped over it. I walked away not out of anger, but because I finally realized I couldn't stay where I wasn't valued.

You might not even notice the silence at first. Days might pass, weeks even, before you feel the absence. Maybe it will hit you when you go to tell me something and realize I'm not there. Or when you need someone to lean on, and you remember how I used to show up for you—every single time.

But by then, it will be too late.

I hope it was worth it. I hope whatever you chose—whatever moment, person, or priority that pulled you away—gave you everything you needed, even if it meant losing me.

I hope it made you happy, even as it left me feeling like I was something disposable.

I hope you found what you were looking for, even if it left me wondering if I was ever enough.

Because you know what? I would have stayed. I would have forgiven. I would have fought for us if you had shown me I was worth it. But you didn't.

I really hope you don’t regret it one day, when you realize what you lost.

I hope it was worth never hearing me laugh, never seeing my name pop up on your screen, never having someone who loved you as much as I did.

Most of all, I hope when the weight of it all settles in, you don’t find yourself wondering what it might have been like if you’d chosen differently.

I knew what I was doing was wrong but I fell in a cycle of drinking waking up feeling horrible and drinking to get rid of that feeling. I knew it was not sustainable and I truly know it was bad to be drinking the way I was. This led to my family forcing me to go to rehab. I was there for 28 days and just got home yesterday.

offmychest,1ie5ybn,I s*cked off my married boss a few times,"I’m a female in my twenties my boss is in his forties. About two years ago I was staying late to catch up on some work and we were the last two people in the office. We got to talking about innocent things and he sat next to me while I worked. Next thing I know his knee is against mine and it felt good and I left it there. A little while later he straight up asked me if he could kiss me… when I turned to face him and started telling him no, he’s married he grabbed my face and kissed me…. I didn’t do anything to stop it or protest… we kept kissing and stood in the office making out for a while. I left that day and spent all weekend with a dreadful feeling thinking I totally screwed up and surely this would bite me in the behind. Come Monday morning I purposely got there super early knowing he’d be alone so I could ask him about it and I did and he just asked me if we could talk about it after work. He texted me later and asked me to meet him somewhere after work to grab a bite to eat and talk about it. In the restaurant he kept kissing me and basically was acting as if we were BF and GF, after wards he asked if we could talk in his car for a bit. In the car he kissed me some more. He right away reaches into my top and pulled it up and pulled my bra down and started kissing my chest and touching me all over. He undid his pants and whipped it out and basically grabbed my head and guided me to it. Afterwards the drive home I had that gut punch feeling of “this is so so wrong” and I felt terrible but I also felt I was in too deep and was at risk of losing my job if I tried to stop anything… I had only been at this job for 4 months at this point and it was the first job I had found that paid me super well and that I really loved. This continued for about two months, just us meeting up after work and touching, kissing, etc never fully went all the way, he did plan on getting us a hotel to “do it” fully but things kept coming up and it never happened. In a weird twist I was asked out by one of my coworkers and went out with him and we’ve been together ever since and I’m extremely happy and in love. I never met up with my boss after the first time I went out with my current BF, my boss caught wind pretty quickly we were dating and we did meet one day in his office to talk about it and he vowed to never say a word to anyone about it and that it would never affect my job and he’s kept his word. I still carry a lot of guilt and shame and get disgusted with myself thinking about it… he’s married and he’s my boss and I feel guilty I’ve never told my BF and I just can’t imagine how he would react. He’s actually pretty cool with our boss and they have a really good relationship…. I know he doesn’t even remotely suspect this ever happened…. 

EDIT -

I’d like to clarify that my boss is the OWNER of the business so there is no one I could have “reported” him to…. This is why i felt such immense pressure to comply or lose my job when I was in a situation that losing my employment just wasn’t an option…. I clearly said I turned to say no and remind him he was married when he GRABBED me and kissed me. Again, I was alone with a very large and intimidating man who’s in a position of power over me. I’d also like to mention my boss likes to drink in His office after every shift… so by the time this happened he was pretty drunk. Was I wrong for not pushing him off? Yes. But I felt afraid and honestly like I didn’t have a choice at the moment. Looking back maybe I shouldn’t have stayed late knowing I’d be alone with him… but I honestly stayed to catch up on work nothing else, I wasn’t expecting nor hoping something like this would happen. I never said I was proud of this or that this was something I felt good about. I was a young girl at a new job that got into a situation that I never intended too and felt forced with no way out, como my or lose my livelihood at a time I had just gotten out of being basically homeless…. Could I have done more? Probably but I didn’t see it that way. I was new at a job and still getting to know my bosses character and how he’s react to me telling him no. I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!! I was basically “saved” from the situation u knowingly by my amazing BF that my boss loves and respects very much and respected him enough to never even look my way again. And as I said I felt disgusted and ashamed. It was wrong yes but to say I’m a pig or a terrible person isn’t true. It’s extremely easy to judge and shame someone you don’t know about a situation you’ve never been in just from a Reddit post.

offmychest,1ie1dwr,I dont think think I'm attracted to my wife anymore,"I've always seen myself as bisexual. So when my spouse came out as trans (mtf) I didn't think it would be a problem. But it's been 7 months now, and I my feelings have wavered. I've always preferred men over women romantically, but as far sex goes, I dont really care. It took a lot of self reflection, but Im realizing now I've never really been in love with or had romantic feelings towards women. Men & trans men, I've fallen for all the time. No issues there. I've never really sought out a woman before, my love interests have always been either cisgender men or transgender. I've had short-lived fwb situations with women, but nothing lasting or concrete.

The more feminine my wife becomes, the more sad I feel, but it's complicated. I'm so happy she's coming out of her shell, I'm happy shes discovering her own style, she's never really cared about clothes before but now she wants clothes to express herself and I know it makes her smile. But...it feels like I'm married to a stranger. It feels like I didn't really know her, and her new personality is coming out--and its a lovely one, but...I'm not really attracted to her, romantically. I feel like we are roommates. But problem is, she loves me so, so much. And I know she would be devastated. Not to mention, with how everything is going to shit now in the U.S., I'd feel like a complete dickhead if i left her now. I'd still want to be her friend and support her, of course. It just feels so awful to think about. 

I lie in bed at night crying myself to sleep because I'm not really happy. I feel no romance towards her, nothing at all. It didn't go away immediately, it slowly diminished after 7 months. I feel like a fucking asshole and I just want to suck it up and be there for her. Why can't I just love her like i used to? I've been so supportive, buying her makeup, helping her get properly sized clothes, giving her comfort when the dysphoria runs wild. 

I just don't want to be sad anymore. I want to love my partner again.",1,2025-01-31 00:54:06,3,0.6,Glad_Salamander_8130
offmychest,1idbdpt,I'm a woman and I dislike most people. I can't fake it til I make it.,"I have friends but if they left me I would get over it. 
I connect with very few people. 
I've tried in the past, but I genuinely dislike people and the social ""games"" people play.
The social hierarchy is bullshit. 

Even adults get ""popular"" by gossiping a little, sticking to the herd mentality and singing out the ones that don't quite fit in for whatever reason.

Style choice, not caring about getting manicures and other girly things, not participating in office gossip, being the only one who dressed different or listens to metal inside a group of uppity white girls/women. 

Being too nice, not nice enough, etc. 
It doesn't matter. 

Im very sure my encounters with people early in life, as well as my mom not bonding to me as a kid has greatly impacted my opinions. I'm aware of this. 

Its half genetic half environmental. 

Regardless, I don't like most people. 
I can't fit in. 
If it means abandoning myself or fit in for a job, I'll get fired every time. 

It feels like it's me against the world. I'm a nice person but I do have a chip on my shoulder.
I've been burned over and over. 

I just don't have the gene to make friends in a social setting besides the places I frequent where people are just like me , and they like to party and are extremely open minded. 

Its not that I'm not open minded, I just for the life of me cannot make any sort of connection with most people.

I have nothing in common with most of the people from every job Ive ever worked at. 

I'm about to go to work in an office full of typical semi uppity women and I'm worried. 
This is the best job I've ever had, and I'm scared.

To be clear, I can be nice to people, and I am, but I don't like most people. 
Its not long before people start to pick up on the fact that I'm different.

My opinions, who I am, how I operate, the people I hang around are just ""different"".
That doesn't go over well. 

I have to protect myself and be standoffish OR I end up telling people information that ALWAYS comes back to bite me in the ass. I end up becoming a target either way. 

Just a casual mention of me listening to a certain kind of music, the fact that im not Christian, not being cliquey, it alk affects how women treat me. 

I can't make myself like people. I don't like them. Most everyone sucks for different reasons.

I'm OK with being alone , but I even worry about the fact that it doesn't bother me that I hate most people.

The ONLY reason it bothers me is because it makes my life a lot harder. 
Its cost me my job several times. 
I'm running out of careers lol. I have 2 licenses. 

I just can't stand how fake most people are, and I'm also a bit envious of people who can navigate society so easily. 

How do they CARE to ask others about their day? What they did over the weekend? 
Why do I care to know anything about most people? 
I don't. 

I don't care to make a connection with them ..which is good because I can't, but its making life really hard. 

I'm just venting I guess. I can't change. 
I either like you or I don't. If I don't, I'll still be nice, but I've never been able to ""fake it til you make it"" and fit in. 

Even if I did fit in, I still don't like them and want to be left alone . Ugh  😂 😭

I wish I could be interested in people. I wish I had it easy and could at least fake it. I just can't. ",52,2025-01-30 03:04:44,56,0.93,Avoidantazzhole

offmychest,1ie14jn,Feeling like I will never really belong in the upper middle class,"Idk if this fits here or what is really the point of it. I suppose I just want to get it off my chest and see if anyone can relate.

I was a first gen university student. Mom is a cleaning lady and dad was a carpenter until he became chronically unemployed and alcoholic. What made me a good student was the promise of having  a better life, live comfortably. And I was lucky to get scholarships, have moved abroad (I always wanted to just go FAR), and have a good job. I know I am lucky and also that my efforts have paid off.

But today, having a dinner with colleagues, something dawned on me: the feeling that I will never, never belong.

When it comes to social situations, there are a lot of conversations I can't relate to. I did not grow up going to private school, or went on a skiing holiday, or learned to play classic instruments, or was introduced to art. I do not have a fine palate that knows all the cuisine from a bunch of different cultures, or know how to throw a big party to entertain others in celebrating my achievements/milestones. I do not naturally spend my time discovering the best restaurants in the city or taking up some interesting and expensive hobby. Growing up it was just me, my neighborhood, my group of friends hanging out at the park, watching TV, listening to music. If I had to pinpoint the biggest cultural or social experience of my childhood it would be the scouts. So I just can't relate to these people's stories or what they like to do with their life. I am happy to enjoy my time spent in my nice apartment that has costed me so much and save my money because no one will save me if I lose it. I do not  go on amazing trips or do some fancy sport. I am OK going to the gym or running outside, it's good enough for me. I do not go to the opera, I am fine with a movie at home. I will never understand how it is to be them, even if I am ""them"" now. I will still relate much more to a friend from back home telling me how she scrapes by or how she is stuck in a bad relationships loop than any of this.

And this is just socially. Professionally... I thought I was good, but there is something I am missing that these people have. It always bugged me thay I am a terrible public speaker and today I kind of understood why. These people were trained for it. Either their parents paid attention to them or they were put into some other environment that nurtured them and made them good at this sort of things. Their development of social skills was important to their families. But nobody paid attention to me. Nobody cared what I had to say, or worried about my social skills, and now, my brain just does not have the most remote idea what to do when people pay attention to me and think there is something I should be saying? My mind it is still like, me??? You think I am like, relevant?... Impostor syndrome. And the reason why I am better at all the hard work and tasks that nobody wants to do is because... I am the dumbass that will do all of that to try to prove my worth while my peers just think they are too good to bother with it.  

There will always be a distance between me and them. And sometimes I even feel I'd be happier if I was just a cleaner like my mom because I would not have to spend my life feeling like an outsider. Even though, as I said, i know I am lucky.

Anyhoo...  If you got all the way here, thank you for reading.

offmychest,1idhbx4,I made the presidential list for grades at school but my mom isn’t here to celebrate with me,"I’m 27, this is my third term of college, and I’ve really come a long way from where I was. I didn’t have a great childhood and struggled with school as a kid/teen, and was homeless as a young adult. My ma went to college when I was in middle and high school and graduated the same year I would have if I didn’t drop out. And then she got a good job, and promptly got extremely sick and died from diabetes complications 5 and a half years ago. Since then I’ve been homeless again and definitely had some bad experiences that made me never want to go back to that. 

I got a housing grant because of my disabilities and decided to use this absolute blessing to try and go back to school since I haven’t figured out a job I can hold down yet. I almost quit school like twice already but I’ve been having a great time working through the writing program and learning how to edit and publish things. My ma would love to see me winning right now. 

This morning, I got the email that I made the presidential list for last term. I dont really check my grades, I think it helps if I’m just doing the work and not getting myself hung up on numbers and scores and all. I checked the grades I got for last term and I have a 4.0 GPA— something that’s NEVER happened to me before. I’m so proud of myself, and also extremely sad because I know my mom would be over the moon about this accomplishment. I went from literally never doing homework as a teen and adopting a “D’s to degrees” mindset (used to be C’s but that standard was too high lol) to now being a straight A student by accident. She would plan a huge party for me, even going so far as to invite random people off the bus or from the store to come party (she was an extremely social person, and did this kinda thing several times while I was growing up). I don’t know if I’ll throw a party, but I am going to go get myself a tallboy from the convenience store in a minute (: 

If you read this far, thank you. I consider reading this post, even if you dont interact, a form of celebration with me and with her. I’ll consider posting this to anonymous strangers, my way of carrying on her legacy of celebrating big things with anybody who’ll listen. ",21,2025-01-30 08:09:25,13,0.96,enotron

Once you die, the brain eventually follows suit, and the parts of it that make anything matter to you shut down, which means that your life doesn't have value to you anymore.

Something worthless to me has more value than something that brings me net misery, and living is one of those, so life will be more valuable to me after death.

offmychest,1ie0u1u,I am terrified of doctors and I don’t know what to do,"(English is not my first language, and i made this burner account bc my sister knows my main Reddit username.)

I’m not sure how it started, but a few years ago I told my sister I didn’t like hospitals and doctors and she told me to watch a Korean drama about a group of doctors and it made my fear only worse. I remember there was scene where they showed the friendly and smart main character kidney doctor and compared him to his really mean and angry colleague and all I could think about was the poor patients who happened to be with the mean kidney doctor who was so rude and dismissive to them. Since then the fear started growing.

Then, my brother got a girlfriend who is a doctor. She is very nice, and she once invited me to a party she organized and most of her friends there were also doctors. 90% of the doctors I spoke to only studied because their parents were also doctors. The other 10% had parents who were dentists or something similar. My brothers gf told me she wanted to become a doctor because she was interested in the human body, but her parents are also pharmacists. I’m not sure if this is just specific to my country (I don’t want to specify where I’m from sorry, but it is europe) but I did not know there was such a big nepo baby culture. I must’ve been so naive, but I thought doctors became doctors because they want to help people and cure them. Not because their parents got them these positions. 

Also, all of them were white (and rich) and my brother and me were the only poc in that whole party. This is not that big of a deal I guess but I just noticed there was such a weird gap in their lives experiences and mine, and I could not at all relate to the doctors lives. I felt very weird and a little alienated (?) so I left the party early.

Later i was talking to my brother about the party and I told him half jokingly that I wish robots or AI would take over doctor jobs, just so I wouldn’t have to be scared of them having a bad day or being racist or something. My brother got really angry because he thought I was insulting his gf, and told me she studied for years to become a doctor. I know that. I know that even the nepo babies had to study hard, but they are still human. Humans have bad days or are just mean or are tired. Even on their worst days they have to treat people who are at their most vulnerable. I heard doctors cannot talk about their mental problems because they might lose their job. And they have to work long and hard hours. I hope I don't sound too arrogant when I talk about wanting a perfect doctor who is always nice and genuinely wants to cure every person. 
 
Now, all of this has happened a while ago and I forgot my fear a bit. But I have had wrist pain for the past 6 months, and I’ve been to 3 different PTs and have done acupuncture, and now my PT had told me I need to make an appointment with a plastic surgeon because I might need surgery. All my fears have come back and I am just terrified. I am so scared I might have to get surgery from someone who does not care at all or has a bad day. I wonder if anyone else has the same fear as me.

offmychest,1idrszd,Advice needed: I got taken advantage of by a family friend,"This is going to be a long one. 

TLDR: I got taken advantage of by a family friend and I don't want to tell my parents but he's not going away even after an initial confrontation.

I 22F met a man 55M during COVID in lockdown. He works at a restaurant that my family frequents but I only met him during COVID as we got takeout from there regularly. It started as simple conversations/getting to know me which proceeded to messaging and meeting in private. After a few months we started dating. At the time I was 19 so nothing was technically illegal. He also started getting closer with my family and my parents.

This situation went on for almost 2 years when I finally broke up with him. Let me be clear, this is not a sugar daddy situation or money. He also did not force himself on me or hit me. His intention starting something with me was to teach/show me how future partners should treat me. This was my first real relationship and also first time I had an intimate relationship. I always thought this would just be an unconventional experience but did not see anything wrong with it. I met my current boyfriend 22M and told him about everything. I knew I would probably get judged and he might leave me but some part of me wanted to tell him. He did not leave and truly loves me. He realized that something was wrong soon after I told him my story and lead me to the realization that I was taken advantage of (I won't share all the details here but there were pretty big indicators). My boyfriend also got me to tell my older brother about what happened.

A couple months back my boyfriend and I confronted the man who I will call Edward (fake name). My boyfriend told Edward to stop contacting my family because he still keeps in contact with my parents. Edward did not see anything wrong with what we did but he ended the conservation and abruptly left. I had blocked him on social media but right after that meeting, he requested to follow me. Edward has also been posting stories of things related to me (no photos of me). 

I recently found out that Edward initially stopped but has continued to contact my parents. I do not want to tell my parents because they will most likely go nuclear. I once asked Edward what would happen if my parents found out and he said that he will most likely lose his job. I am at the point where I do not feel anger towards him but he has a 6-year-old daughter. Edward has an atypical terminal disease that will mean he will likely die in the next 5 years or so and it will not be fun. I do not care if he loses his job but I don't want to hurt his daughter because I know she is already going to grow up without a dad and the situation is complicated. I am quite sure he isn't a risk to her in terms of SA (other details that I won't share). 

My boyfriend is genuinely concerned that Edward is going to come back and push more boundaries to see what he can get away with. I do not want to tell my parents because I am scared of what they will think because I still blame myself for what happened and I really don't want his daughter to potentially get dragged through this. I am planning on asking my brother to message Edward to tell him that he knows and hopefully scare him off. Also, my family has not been to the restaurant in a few months because they closed for renovations. My parents have asked Edward to go out for meals but he declined. My boyfriend thinks the only way to fully get rid of Edward is by telling my parents.

offmychest,1ie0bap,I no longer will travel with my best friend ever again,"How do I cope with adult female friends who aren’t being accountable?

I recently went on an overseas trip for the first time with my best friend of over 12 years. She’s going through a lot and planning, booking and making the itinerary fell to my hands. We’ve booked the flight a year ago but when I contact her over the past few months regarding the trip, it’s always the same: she’s too busy to make time and plan the trip. Being understanding, I decided to do it myself because who else will at this point.

During the trip, we got into an argument regarding a souvenir that the restaurant gives out. Before that, a few days have passed and she’s been making comments about “maybe this would have been better if there was a tour guide” or complaining that after we had a full day that she wanted a slow day. I communicated to her if there were issues with my itinerary and that we can adjust if need be but she doubled down and said nothing’s wrong. I was like okay but deep in my mind— why complain?

Since she did not prepare her phone and check the itinerary, I was left to navigate the whole trip by myself while she just followed. She then proceeded to ask me multiple questions such as “Where are we going? How long does it take to get there? How many minutes is the walking? What’s the name of the hotel?”— all of which is in the itinerary I sent her prior on sheets (which is available offline if you download it). I felt like I was being taken advantage of and being treated as a tour guide at this point but decided to understand that her internet on her phone wasn’t working (though it was because of her lack of preparation and refusal to download it over the hotel wifi) but decided to let it go. I later asked her if she figures out her phone then can she help me navigate because its my first time in that country too.

Back at the restaurant:

I saw her hand hovering over the souvenir for awhile when the check was put down and when we finally paid, she just took it. I told her “Hey, I also want that, aren’t you going to ask me if I want it too?”. She replied “if you want one, then I can ask for another one” which I said okay. As we exited the restaurant, I asked where my souvenir was she said she was going to ask but she then said “oh, I didn’t get to ask since I just walked out”. I said let’s go back so you can ask because I want it too like I already planned everything if you can just give me that small thing it would be noce but she got mad and said “you know what? Take it! Its yours! I dont want it anymore!”. I was shocked at her tantrum at me because it was such a small thing and so I talked to her and told her not to treat me like that because I’m her friend.

She said I was holding resentment for planning everything and poorly communicating my needs and that if I was a true friend that I wouldn’t be asking for anything back. If she planned a trip then just go with it she said. She even asked angrily and shouted “what do you want me to do? Grovel and bend my knees in front of you as thanks?!”. I told her we shouldn’t talk if she’s this angry but she then said “this is what you wanted right? You wanted to talk? Now deal with it and be uncomfortable with it! You wanted this!”

Sad to say, I cried because it seemed like she wasn’t even listening to me and suddenly I’m an asshole for using the planning of the trip to get the souvenir. I told her I was trying to be understanding of her but I just wanted a little appreciation for the work I put in. I communicated to her that I needed help and tried to see if there were any issues with the itinerary I planned but she said it was okay. I told her that she said she’d go back to ask but she didn’t even do that little thing for me. I didn’t want her to grovel or bend her knees, but I just wanted her to show a little appreciation for the work I put in to make this trip happen and ask for that souvenir, is that too much to ask for?

I realized maybe I am wrong for saying that I planned the itinerary but as a friend, did I deserve that kind of response? 

Btw, I paid the upfront costs of paying for the museum, hotels and activities and I would have to remind her to pay me 4 weeks later after I requested it. I also had to wake her up like I was her mom so that she can get ready.

I’m now reflecting on that trip and decided that she’s still my friend but I no longer will be traveling with her in the future. I don’t like her response of aggressiveness, laziness and lack of consideration but I can’t help feel that should I really just take that? I put in the work but am I wrong to think that I deserve a little thank you?

So how do I cope with a friend like this? NEVER TRAVEL WITH THEM EVER. 

TLDR: went on a trip with a friend. She was hard to communicate with so I was forced to plan the trip. She then proceeds to make comments about the trip and when confronted she explodes and tells me that as a friend I shouldn’t be expecting anything in return for planning the trip because we’re friends. 

Also, she said she didn’t want to think on the trip and just wanted to enjoy but if she doesn’t think then who will….

I could’ve escaped from my abusive situation YEARS ago but I’m just a stupid fucking coward who’s afraid of my dad’s anger because he threatens to kill people, has anger issues, and a gun. But I didn’t. All I do is cry and whine when everyone escapes from their abusive situations early.

I can barely do anything here because they’re so controlling. My parents barely do anything about my special needs brother.

I want to snap because I tell friends about my situation and they say “oh you’re doing the right thing” no I’m not. Everyone says I should’ve moved out by now on the internet.

Now it’s too late. I’m graduating with my bachelors too late at 29 because I took 6 years for a community college degree because my parents paid for it and made me feel like I was too stupid to take more than 2 classes. I missed out on so much because of these “overprotective” pieces of shit.

And when I try to gain independence they get mad and say I don’t tell them anything. But how am I when you intentionally sabotage things?

Even when I get out in a year or two, I think I’m probably going to off myself anyways. I’m already close because when I get upset I self harm myself now. Wish I could actually make gashes but I can’t. 

Nobody wants to try to help me. They say they’ll be supportive but I’m sure they find my suffering funny. Or think I’m pathetic. The neighbors hear the yelling daily I’m pretty sure. But nobody calls the police or gives a shit. Nobody even takes note that I’m obviously being abused because my parents treat me like a disabled child. All because I had to act too weird as a kid for an autism diagnosis. All because I had to be too sensitive and explosive through out my life. I regret not hiding everything since birth.

Maybe doing this is a better idea because maybe then people will feel bad that they fucked me over. Even if I try to repair my trauma when I move out by doing whatever I want it’s far too late. I give up",2,2025-01-30 20:11:32,2,1.0,rainbowbrites
offmychest,1idrj8n,I miss my one friend way too nuch,"well, idk where to start but I always feel like I never had any friends. talking to most of the ppl felt like I'm trying to fit in at a place I don't  belong and I have thoughts like everyone has their own friend group so why would they wanna talk or share anything with me and I back off most of the time...I've been like this since covid came(switched my personality in a negative way)

so, back to where it all started, in 6th class I was a typical class clown who wanted to get attention and I alway failed miserably, during a ptm me and my mom were sitting in my class and there was girl and her mom sitting in front of us...my mom started talking to her mom and I looked at that girl and realized that I never noticed her in class till now...and that day my mom made me friends with her and took her mom's number (yea i had no social skills and had to rely on my mom to get friends)...I started sitting a desk behind her in class we got to know each other and I was darn happy that I actually made a friend, but still i was an annoying kid...I would either pull her hairs or just poke her head to annoy her...idk how she felt about this coz I didn't knew that I can even ask these things, in lunch breaks I would make balls of the foil paper and toss her on her head..ofc I wasn't the only one doing all those mischieves...so some other girl complained about a boy doing this to her and our teacher punished him, I just looked at her and I was literally begging with my facial expressions to her to not to complain about it..and she just smiled and gave an assuring blink saying that she won't..I was in shock ..i cried that day and thought even if I get a friend I'm a type of person who can't keep things that way and I always have to f up everything, like man she was too sweet, I would ask her to do my work and she would do it..if she brought anything I like in lunch we would eat together and in short she was too wholesome and genuine to be true..I didn't deserve her. When we came to 7th class (mid of 7th) something happened in school and her father was called (some guy who liked her asked her out and when she denied it that guy complained about it to her brother..he was also in same school as ours but in 10th and then everything became a mess) she just stopped talking to me..she didn't say a single word to me the whole 7th. unfortunately we got different sections in 8th and we almost never saw or talked to each other...even on bday neither she wished me nor I wished her for some reason. she changed her school in 9th when covid just started.

I forgot about her everything went on online platforms and I got involved in playing games and just existing like a lame person ..all this went on till mid 10th when a guy told me there's a thing called insta and I should join it...so I did at start I was bored of insta I was like why ppl use this...there is nothing intresting till one day i saw her request, yea the same girl..i was like...atleast she is alive, and out of nowhere we started talking and it was like very normal conversation (I wanted to ask why did she stop talking but I didn't and just went on with things) but she would randomly disable her accounts for weeks sometimes months and when she would log back in all she said was""i just zone out sometime""...and I was like for that long?

and then I joined a coaching and there I met a girl had a lil crush on her we started dating and basically she became what my friend was but I liked this girl and things went smoothly till I joined ALLEN FOR JEE in 11th and I realised that my friend was in Allen too, just a floor below me I wanted to talk but we had different batch timings and I never talked to her...by this time she deleted her insta account and went complete ghost mode

everything going good all great until Nov of last year..I lost my mom in an accident,(3 weeks before my birthday..3 weeks before it)
I felt too lost..on my day.. I didn't want do anything why would I.. neither my condition was like that nor was it morally right...but my friend and my gf forced me to come to a cafe and just have a lil smthing ..i said agreed and went with it..but I didn't feel comfortable and left in between without any explanation 

I didn't give the jee jan attempt coz i was focused on 12th boards more ..i gave them and started preparing for april attempt of jee...and when my boards got over ..I just got the craziest news ever ...on my day after I left ..my gf kissed one of my friend and I was like things couldn't have been any worse and yea i was totally f**ked up from head to toe
,every now and then I see my dad cry, I am again back at a place where I don't have any friends..idk whom to trust where to go what to do

the day I was going to give my april attempt i made up my mind that I will kms and just get out of this mess..and guess what whom do I meet that day...u guessed it...the girl from the class 6th just as I'm about to enter the hall I see her...I rush to her and I'm seeing her after idk..3 years...she is unrecognizable but we end up talking for 5-10 mins and my mood was lift up I was suddenly happy...my exam went great I was sure I will get 200+..i come out i start talking to her again..we talk for like half an hour until my dad comes to pick me up...I just said byee to her and I was going with my dad...and just a minute later I realized ..I don't have her contact or any way to reach out to her...I go back there but she was gone..i tried to look for her but she was no where to be seen and I gave up...but I didn't want to kms anymore...just one talk with her...I felt so light that I wanted to live now...I got lucky and cleared jee adv too and got a mid 4 digit rank...I was getting a mediocre iit but I wanted cs so I took drop ...and just a few weeks ago I was watching story of a girl I know from school and she happens to be one of her that girl's friend and I asked if u have been in touch with her and where she is...so I got to know that she took drop too but she wasn't answering any calls neither to any msgs 
. yesterday I gave my Jan attempt and I was hoping that I could meet her, but I couldn't..I was so desperate..I started calculating probability of me meeting her ...I just wanted to meet her yesterday and say ""Kal toh birthday hai bhai...party kaha degi""
all these scenarios going in my head...I was too overwhelmed...but yeah..things never happen the way I want.i could ask her friend for her number but I don't want to do that, it feels creepy and not a right thing to do...she is not on insta..neither on snap...nowhere..i even checked my mom's phone if I could find her number but that number belongs to her brother now and I can't dare do anything or I will be ded fr

idk man..i just wanna meet her and talk to her like I used to..no filter...talking about anything ...I miss her...she comes in my life just at the time I need her and then dissappears ..damn I really miss her

offmychest,1id7izl,I still think of that time when my partner's friend told me to kill myself,"Happened a while ago. My partner and I were in a coffee shop with his friends. He was busy working on his laptop so it was just me bantering with them. One of them, let's call him Timmy.  Timmy is that friend. He is awkward and says edgy stuffs a lot. He'd say things like he wishes downfall/death on the friends he has disagreements with, that sort of deal. Everyone else goes along with it because that's just how he is.

Timmy doesn't know but at that point in time I was going through a dark place. I had just the week before admitted to my partner about by persistent suicidal thoughts. I'm doing much much better now. Til this day my partner is the only person who knows.

That night, Timmy being Timmy, loudly announced to me, ""If I give you money will you kill yourself?"" I was taken aback. He kept going, ""I'll give you money if you kill yourself. ""

I responded by extending my hand signalling to him to give me the money, he hesitated then gave me a quarter. Another friend, I guess as a way to lighten up the mood, gave me another quarter. I think we joked a bit more about me killing myself before moving on with the night.

I thought my partner didn't notice our conversation but when we got back to his place and I placed the quarters on his desk, he looked at me and said ""no suicide, ok?"" I said no. He asked me if I was upset at his jokes, and I just blurted out, ""No, Timmy is just a r/*t/*rd."" Yeah, I know, my word choice wasn't the best. My partner chuckled and we left it at that.

For months the two quarters just stayed in the same place where I set them down. Eventually I put the quarters away but they are still in my partner's place. I don't want to take them. 

There is no moral to be had, no rhyme nor reason behind this story. I'm just throwing it out there because somehow, after months, it stills bugs me slightly and I don't know why. ",78,2025-01-30 00:09:14,19,0.94,Fluid-Box-482
offmychest,1idzz53,I’m (33M) now head over heels for my long distance friend (30F) I finally met in person and don't know how to proceed...,"I (33M) have been talking to this girl (30F) for 7 years on Instagram. She’s a semi popular model with 100k followers and I’m just a normal dude with 250 followers. By some miracle, she saw my first message all those years ago and we’ve talked on Instagram for all these years. We live about 1000 miles from each other and have tried to meet multiple times but it never worked because whenever I was where she lives, she wasn’t around, and vice versa (we both travel a lot). Finally, this past week, we finally met after all these years. We had a 4 hour lunch together and it was like we had known each other for years instantly and we had so much fun laughing and telling stories and really getting to know each other more deeply than our silly Instagram messages. Halfway through lunch she leans across the table and goes “how long are you here?” and I said “I have to fly out tomorrow morning”. Without skipping a beat she says “change your flight”. I couldn’t because I had a business dinner that I had to be at that night but MY GOD did I want to stay longer and hangout more. She’s so funny, sweet, and just as gorgeous in person and I honestly thought I was dreaming while sitting across from her at lunch. I’ll admit I had a bit of a crush all this time but now I’m actively thinking of trying to spend winters where she lives to be closer and see her more.

I’m smitten and don't know how to proceed given our distance and many years of friendship...

Some context I think is important: I have never sent her money of any kind, the only money I've ever spent on her was during lunch when she tried to pay for her fair share (she drinks and I don't) but I insisted on splitting it even. Our relationship has been strictly platonic with the occasional playful/joking flirt, I have maybe made some cheeky comments on some of her modeling photos, which were well received, but nothing overt. We live 1000 miles away from each other so I am aware something romantic would be unconventional at best but she does seem interested in hanging out when she comes up here (she proposed the idea) and I definitely would like to see her whenever I go down there.",1,2025-01-30 23:50:28,0,0.67,CharcuterieBoard

I used to give her advices and tipo and he would always talk about his problems and also complaining about her class-mates (we are in different schools)


But she is now starting to get away from our friendship after everything i've done: i stayed up really late so I could hear him complain and help him, I also helped her with homework, I kept her company but now she would rather spend time with the classmates that he used and still complains about with me


Im honeslty tired becouse,every time I do something she just says that im stupid and I need to grow up, at this point its better to end it there i suppose.

offmychest,1idu1l2,I miss my cousin and I hate people,"I don't really know where to go with this. I just wanted to scream and put this somewhere where no one I know sees this, so this is a throwaway inadvance. So I'm sorry if this full of ramblings and is long or something I just, I don't know. 

The past year has been rough for me. I lost my childhood pet who I had for over twenty years and I lost my cousin to cancer. And don't even get me started on the state of America right now. 

So it definitely feels like my life is in tatters. And then what makes it even worse is that my cousin who passed left two beautiful twin boys and her night nurse who took care of her and watched me and the rest of my family grieve her death and watched her pass, is dating her boys' father. 

5 months. It has only been 5 months since she's been gone. 

I knew this lady was trying something when she got so close so fast. I warned him because I cared and loved him just as much as my cousin. And this happened. 

I can't help but blame myself because I wasn't there as much as I said I would. But this nurse was. I don't know what to do. I've been so lost without her because my cousin was like a part of me. She knew me better than anyone else. 

And now I've been spiraling. I havent texted him or anything since learning he started dating this nurse. All I can think is that I lost all respect and I hate him. But then I feel bad because I can't hate him completely. But then I wonder, how long til this nurse forces him to get rid of things that my cousin used to use? How long until she gets rid of photos of her? How long until this nurse gets her claws into the twins and forces my cousin's side of the family away? My family. 

Because that's who she is. I knew she had ulterior motives. Knew that she wanted to date him. I called it. I tried to voice my concerns about it. So I know I can say she's going to erase my cousin's memory so she can be the only mother figure in their lives. 

And I'm terrified. I'm tired. I just wanna cry until I pass out. If anything this just furthers my trust issues into my everyday life. I don't know. I'm sorry I just needed a place to vent. ",2,2025-01-30 19:40:55,0,1.0,Sharp_Comfortable171
offmychest,1idzeop,sexual dream about an ex classmate,i (22F) have a boyfriend and i had a dream about hanging out with friends last night and it got weird when i met an ex classmate (also a girl) of mine in the dream whom i no longer speak to irl. we are just added on social media and interact with stories. there was this random moment where she took me to a more private place to speak and things got kinda sexual. i've always thought i'm not fully straight but what's bothering me is that i saw this in my dream when i have a bf who i love more than anything and would never cheat on. what makes things worse is that i was the one who made the move in the dream. and in my dream i felt like i did something wrong and cheated on my bf right after she left. i felt guilty even in the dream and i woke up feeling dread. am i a cheater? i know weird sexual dreams happen to people but i always see my boyfriend in my sexual dreams and this is new. i never even had a crush on this girl or find her attractive in any way and fully made a move in the dream. the guilt is eating me alive. ,1,2025-01-30 23:25:46,2,1.0,luvsboah

I try everyday, and i dont want to stop trying, i listen to ""star seeds"" and talk to ""magick practioners"", i tell myself they work, that they're real.  
I want to believe aliens will come and swoop us off our feet, that gods will intervene and restore the damage, that when we die we arent just gone, and everyday im reminded that im screaming at a void.  
Im tired of believing, of faith and hope, i wont stop believing, but my confidence wanes.
We were born into a world where our lives were controlled, greed burnt into the earth crust and no say in the matter, where our elders, the ones who fumbled from the start; still retained control.  
We could have done something years ago but we trusted them, and now even if we did dethrone them we could only delay the inevitable.  
I will keep flashing my light into the sky, i will keep trying to talk to gods, i will keep believing theres a savior, but i find it harder day by day. I dont want us to be alone.

I can't tell anyone in real life because I am so scared people will hate me. I am genuinely so disgusted with the actions of my past self.

How can I possibly believe you want to be with me when you seem determined to act like I don’t exist?

I’m not just your friend you see once every few weeks, text once every few days. I’m supposed to be your partner. A relationship shouldn’t feel the way this feels. I was really falling for you but you grounded me every single time by reminding me that you clearly don’t care the same way.

The saddest part is that in person I see it in your eyes that you do feel something real. I don’t know why you can’t show it over text or other behaviours, but I can’t wait around any longer to figure it out.

I’m doing that annoying ultimatum/test thing no one likes. I’ve put a deadline in place in my mind for when I need to hear from you. If you haven’t reached out by then and apologised for how little you’ve responded to me, completely ignored me today, and bailed on making plans, then I’m finished with you.

I’m finding myself again subconsciously worrying about things I know I don’t need to worry about, when I’m calm my brain is scanning for the thing I’ve missed or forgot about.

I’m feeling anxious about certain aspects of my job, and had nightmares about it. One time I dreamt I swore and flipped out at a class that’s hard for me to control, in my other dream I was getting attacked by a student and chased in a park because I reported them for something ( I did in real life )

These things are not at all likely to happen in real life but somehow I had these bad dreams and woke up feeling really anxious. 

I’m feeling on edge about food a little as well vecause im not feeling as in control as I would like to, sometimes I’m eating a lot to comfort myself from my feelings then I feel awful about it

I’m having other issues that’s making me feel really insecure about myself and I am wearing different clothes to cover up my body cause I feel so bad about how I look

I look in the mirror and I feel crap about myself. My skin looks bad. My sleep is bad. And I just don’t feel good in my skin and body right now 

Apart from that, I’m missing my ex so much and still thinking about him loads, even though it’s been months now and I’m dwelling on the past and our memories every day. 

And it’s just turned 4 years since my mum died yesterday and that whole thing is making me even more sensitive and emotional about the other stuff. I feel like nobody around me understands.

Then a week after classes were done she's homeless and asks me to hang out and again I spent money on her including money my grandparents gave me for graduation. Well she goes out with someone else but still asks me for money. So I spent all I had saved and she kept calling me names cause I wouldn't drive her 3 hours wen all my money was gone. She then has me pick her up. My card gets declined and she makes me spend more. Says she'll go out with me and breaks up with me the next day. Next day she still wants more from me saying she might go back out with me. My parents get angry at me for this but I said noone else will give me attention (it was true no socially responsible woman would give me the time of day)and it goes on all summer.

I'm a 17 years old girl, i have a sister, in 2019 my dad had enough of our mother and she did the same, so they divorced, me and my sister went with our mom while we wasn't much active with our dad, we left the state and went to a new one and we haven't talked with dad for 2 years that mean until 2021/7 we talked, so when we moved to the new state, my uncle came from Canada he used to hate me, he is the worst fucker ever, this guy destroyed my life i hate him so much...when he came from Canada he start to act like a normal uncle until my sister failed in her exams he start screaming at her and me, especially me for no reason, my % were kinda good we are talking about 97% in biology and English is 91% and the rest were 77% and up, we had a rough year until it was 2022 he made up a problem with my grandpa house that includes his 2 brothers and his father, for his sisters (my auntie and mom) they were in his side, until my auntie decided t leave the family fully and live alone with her husband and kids, that day my heart broke, because not only everything start falling apart, but i heard such a word at age i should never know what ""fuck"" or ""bullshit"" meas, but this is normal now, my uncle lets call him (Jackson) start getting more aggressive with me and my sister, *btw he is married and divorced and he has son's complex and can't get his son*, he start to come to our house more often, and throw his clothes at us like we were some kind of maids for him or smth, he start talking about my state because his state was ""physically and mentally better"" and always underestimate me and from time to time when i study with my sister he just come and spit at us or me specifically and go back to sit in the couch for literally no reason...my mom was always with him and support him which was weird, is she under his mercy or smth ? she has the right kick his ass because he is hurting his sister's daughters, what the fuck is going on ?

in 2025/1/4 before middle term exams by a week or 10 days
i was studying like always with my sister while he was sitting in the couch talking about us badly like always, until my sister asked mother if she can help me with studying for a while, so she agreed, and when she came she told us that she was going to go with her friend lets call her (tina) as both of us begged her to come because we couldn't take much more of his words so she said ""yes ofc you can come"", so i was mad and happy at the same time, happy because i can leave, and mad because its not permanent happiness, i said ""i hate him"" my mom looked at me then she slapped me, and told me ""don't talk about ur uncle like that"" that moment i replied without noticing, and said to my sister ""why you got (her) here ?!"" i was mad but when she heard me calling (her) instead of mom she got mad and slapped me again but this time harder, i noticed i was mad and it was mistake to call my mom like this in a disrespectful way so i tried to say sorry but she slapped me again, and my uncle heard smth going on, a talk on heat between me and her so he said loudly (""mother name"" what's with that ""*****""!), when i heard him saying that, i just exploded literally exploded on them, crying and swearing at him and her and even spiting at them too a words that I've caged in my heart since the day he stayed at our house *he needed to stay at our house for 2 months, but i couldn't handle him for 2 weeks*

that day i called my dad and told him I'm coming during that he came near me and start swearing at my dad and me and my dad's wife and literally god everyone, he didn't leave anyone before hitting me with his hands so i pushed him when i pushed him he tried to jump on me again but this time my mom and sister stop him and he ran towards the storage to get smth to hit me with, but i ran towards the storage room and closed it with the key and he ran towards the door and even got hit by it while he was running, my mom asked me to grie her the key but i was so tired and not listening to anything around me i ran towards the bathroom and throw the key there and pressed the button and ran with a few of my stuff i took a taxi and went to my dad state (my state), and i continued a few days before we go to the other state so i can continue my exams there we took a hotel and finished the 10 days there before going back to my dad house.

been a month and 10 days since that, and i had 25 nightmare, the nightmares i had end up me killing my uncle or he kills me or my moms dies on my hands, and i feel depressed, i have booked a therapy online but the fucker won't reply, and I'm afraid to tell my dad all the things inside me, me and my sister are always connected and i always call her, but this is just..fucked


since i was born my life was fucked, the pressure from our parents to the pressure that happened between my mother and auntie and uncle and thier father and brothers, and now uncle and me, you think its fair ?


btw before i go, i heard the fucker saying 
""i wish you die in a car accident""
and 
""but i know you are lucky just like ur daddy"" he said that In a mocking way
and said 
""so i wish you become a drug addict so i can laugh at you"" that was while he was banging the door so hard each time my heart fell off even more, just so you know i can easily hit him, but i just couldn't take what can happen to him, his back is fucked and any damage can lead to paralysis so i was calm always but inside i was eating myself slowly 


sorry if my grammar is bad, but I'm crying while typing that and my grammar is bad already 

i really want to know, what have i done ?
was it really deserved ?
why this happened ?
i really want to say more but that's all what i could say at the moment, i might reply to some comments about the rest of the small events that happened 

and how should i stop... thoughts, all of them.
i have thoughts...lets say ending everything, by running from the entire family or.. dying...but I'm afraid, i am really, i don't want any of that to happen.

I haven't done that tho, and i won't 

thanks for listening, i appreciate it",1,2025-01-30 22:41:47,1,0.99,almalek_0
offmychest,1idbih7,I gave away some pokemon cards,"Something cool happened today and I just felt like telling someone about it. I was at Walmart today and decided to pick up some pokemon cards for my girlfriend (we both enjoy collecting them). While on the bus home I noticed a little Hispanic boy wearing a Charizard backpack. I decided to ask him if likes pokemon, he nodded vigorously and started to list all his favorites and that he finally got a switch for Christmas and started playing the games for the first time. For some reason I reached into my Walmart bag and took out the packs I just bought (like 25$). and handed them to him. I kinda did this without thinking, it just felt like what I should do. His mom who had been mostly ignoring our conversation noticed and started scolding the boy to thank me. She looked slightly flustered but thanked me and said chewy (the boy) was normally quite shy. He wanted to open the cards immediately but his mother told him he had to wait until they got home. Kinda sad lol, I would have liked to see what he got. Anyway that's kinda it, I did impulsively give them to him but it felt right. Luckily the gf wasn't mad lol ",37,2025-01-30 03:11:00,2,0.97,foldupsmile
offmychest,1idssgg,SO and Coparenting,"My daughter is 5 and I am attempting to healthily coparent with ""Dad"" who lives long distance. I have my daughter most of the time, with the exception of my ex coming into town intermittently for weekends/school breaks, but sometimes we work out visits during school weeks and work out a way for him to spend time and for my little girl to come home to go to sleep. I've been dating someone for 9 months and the issue of me having to deal with my ex-husband whether it be via communication, or in person during visitations continues to be an issue for us.

SO is not a parent. I feel he has a hard time understanding that my ex will be in my life forever and that having to deal with him is part of coparenting. He has suggested I cut communication, only remaining on an app, due to some previous transgressions of my ex disrespecting me and belittling me in text messages. Over the course of the last few months, my ex has acknowledged his errors and has course corrected a bit. Rome wasn't built in a day, his communication is 85% about my son, and about 15% friendly and ""checking-in"" in a general way about family, job, life as my ex and I grew up together and I still maintain some semblance of a relationship with my ex's family despite the fact that he no longer lives in the area.

We have had a few disagreements over the course of the last few months that centered around the following:

\- scenarios where my ex or my ex's family have impacted our own schedules or have changed our plans due to timesharing schedules

\-scenarios where my ex has contacted me directly via text or call and I have engaged (not inappropriate communication, just regarding my daughter)

\-scenarios where my ex (SO and I do not live together) has come into my apartment for short bouts of time as my daughter invited him in or asked for assistance with a task (the interaction was handled respectfully and kept to a common area of my apartment)

\-scenarios where my ex and I may need to attend an event for my daughter at the same time

As a result of this discomfort for my SO, my SO has struggled to control emotions at times, ending our dates prematurely or in a hasty attitude, it has led to arguments, disagreements, and constant threats to walk on me... sometimes even a short break up. This has created a ton of stress for me in the moments where this happens, but our afterwards conversations when jets have cooled have demonstrated a desire to be okay with the situation, continue to communicate, and work through it. I know I am loved.

In my dream world, my ex and I can be friendly acquaintances that continue to work together to create a copacetic and peaceful situation for my kid where she is aware that both her parents are capable of working as a team when it comes to her things, events, life, and anything really. My ex and I have a rough past as he treated me very poorly for many years, but we have been divorced for nearly 5 years and in the last year, we have made progress. It has been made clear, however, by my SO that there isn't a need for me and my ex to have any sort of relationship and that I should be collecting my child support check and calling it a day.

I really love my partner. He is extremely supportive and wonderful in every other aspect of my life: my career, my general well-being, my family, and even my daughter when it is just US and my ex is not local. I just struggle with balancing all these ""players"" in the balance, everyone's feelings (my daughter's included), and trying to do the right thing for everyone. I'm often left feeling emotionally exhausted by the fall out and frequently feel a ""walking on eggshells"" sensation that is draining. My ex is maybe present one week a month.

Is there hope in this situation for a healthy relationship with my SO?",2,2025-01-30 18:48:44,0,1.0,Fluffy_Locksmith_508
offmychest,1idy1tp,I feel like i’m not allowed to acknowledge my mental disorder,"I was diagnosed with other-specified obsessive compulsive disorder, which means I have symptoms of OCD but don’t fit the criteria.

I feel like because I dont meet that criteria, i’m not allowed to acknowledge what symptoms i do have because it “isnt that bad.” 

i remember unknowingly being tested by my former psychiatrist. the one question i remember the most was “what is your number” and i immediately said 13. i do everything in 13. cleaning, locking/unlocking doors, tapping the table. 

or when i pray, i pray for one person but then it has to be for two because what if they die if i dont include them. oh and this person, too. and my pets. and this person i havent seen since 2013 etc. or when i pick my scalp and make it bleed or click my throat until it’s sore or idk. i just feel like i cant acknowledge these things because it’s only a symptom. i dont actually have ocd so i feel like im intruding into that space",1,2025-01-30 22:27:59,0,0.67,AdeptFlow2458

It was funny and me and my friend we all had fun. There were pretty girls good music great evening. There was this girl, she was having a drink with us at the table. She asked me if we could take a picture of the toilet for Instagram. You know the stories you always do. I just didn't think anything of it. The alcohol ignited on the way to the toilet - it was a bit longer. I was to drunk like took the photo and yes we just fell in each other kissed and shit. I really didnt need to have sex i was wayyy to drunk and i know we both hadnt had any protection. It wasn't my first time so I know I can't control myself when to finish and im drunk so it is sooo risky. She told me to chill and that she knew when to pull it out. Of course my drunk self didn't think anything of it.... The act itself was horrible I had a headache like crazy.

offmychest,1idxsag,Today I found out the I nearly died when I was being born because of my father,"
Context: I'm the eldest child. 

Anyway, Today, I came to know about how my father used to treat my Mom. I've had really traumatizing nights with them shouting at each other. The last time this happened, my Dad threatened to beat my Mom. 

Today, I came to know that the process of me being born was very hard on my mom and she was in labour for a long time. She was taken to the hospital and my Mom was in way too much pain the whole time. She was pleading that she wanted surgery to be done as she was not able to handle it, but my father and his relatives literally, flat out DENIED it in front of her, saying things like ""Oh, it's just her first time giving birth, it will be a bit painful, of course!"" In. That. Tone. Apparently, she nearly could've died that day, and, as a result, I wouldn't have been born... 

I also came to know that during my brother's birth, Mom experienced the same stuff. My dad literally sent her to the hospital and wasn't even THERE for her in that time. Apparently, he was at home SLEEPING. My mom called him saying her delivery was done and they replied with ""Oh, it's done already?"" The AUDACITY to say it in that time of voice, man. 

My father has made my Mom's life hell... She cries everytime she talks about it, whenever she seeks support from her family members. It hurts seeing her cry... My Mom said that if it wasn't for us, her children, being there, she would've committed suicide aong time ago. My mom was a cheerful and happy girl before she got married to my father. He and his side of the family made her miserable. My father says that my Mom has no rights and has to obey him and live in rags if he says so. WHAT. THE. HELL. He literally doesn't even talk to her politely too. Quite the opposite. He makes me feel miserable, isolates me from people, he once said to me ""Are we looking like some [f-word]-ing [p-word] to you?"" when he saw me watching anime (it was jjk) instead of studying. (My work was literally already completed). Is that how you act towards your son? And whenever my Mom, or I, tried to talk to him about it, he lashes out and acts like he's a freaking saint. He made me have genuine suicidal thoughts. 

And apparently, I kind of look like him in appearances, which genuinely makes me feel sick, and, due to the mental toll on my Mom's emotional health from my father, she breaks down very easily now. I have made her feel bad on accident before, and getting reminded by her that I am becoming like my father (I genuinely don't want to be like him;  And I love my mom, I don't want to make her feel hurt...) makes me feel dead inside... I always try to cheer her up when I can, but the damage has been done several times over now... I wish things were different... I really do...",1,2025-01-30 22:16:45,0,1.0,YEETUSBLEATUS
offmychest,1idxr7l,No one wants to date me,"Three of the last three dates ive gone on have resulted in a text ""sorry, im not feeling it for x reason"".

Which is totally that persons right. 

Ive been single and dating for almost five years. I was always in relationships before that. Im almost 40. 

Most people want to fuck me and thats it. They want my energy and support, but not reciprocation. So, I stopped fucking my dates. Id make them wait several weeks. When they dont get what they want, they tell me they are no longer interested. 

This most recent one hurts the most and has put me in a pretty low mental state. 

I know that none of these people are good for me if they leave me bc I wont fuck them in the first couple weeks, but what gives?  Its been almost a dozen ppl at this point

So i have nothing left but to assume I dont deserve the love for whatever reason. I guess Im just not worth the hassle of getting to know and support me.",1,2025-01-30 22:15:26,7,1.0,Borgirstadir
offmychest,1idxisc,We are no together. My heart aches. But it’s over. That’s it.,"I met C at an office party in October, and he confessed he had a “love at first sight” moment with me. A month later, when I was looking for a place, he offered me a room in his flat. I felt safe with him and moved in. What started as a crush for him turned into love, and though I wasn’t initially attracted to him, I could see his feelings in his eyes, actions and words.

I moved out a week later to avoid mixed signals, but we remained close. I missed him more than I expected—our routines, cooking for him, our music, and our late-night talks. I immediately went back. I couldn’t fall asleep without him around me. We cuddled, kissed, and shared a comfort that felt natural. Things which would usually bother me, didn’t even cross my mind if it were by him. I adored him completely. I honestly couldn’t remember the last time I slept for 8 hours straight before that.

On our way back home from a pre planned trip, the security wanted to check my luggage. I was sure I had my lingerie in it. So I had asked for a female security personnel to check my bag. But my request was delayed for >15 minutes. One of them who was pretty racist yelled at ‘C’ from another corner of the security check-in that he would throw him out of the airport if he didn’t cooperate. I got pretty pissed. When this other guy yelled, I just thought out loud the words “Shut up”. Anyone standing very close to me could obviously hear it. Though I apologised to C for saying that at the airport, he later told me we weren’t compatible. I didn’t question it—I simply thanked him and left.

But we found our way back to each other, and he continued with the same love and affection—talking about “our kids,” holding my hand, comforting me in my sleep. Yet, I couldn’t see that in his eyes. When I finally asked for clarity, he admitted he couldn’t continue. Just two hours after hugging and reassuring me, he chose to walk away. I couldn’t help but think of times he could’ve been there for me and simply wasn’t and left me on my own. 

Now he’s leaving the company and the city, and the thought of seeing his name deactivated in the company, breaks my heart. I don’t care whose fault it is, but my heart aches. I would’ve changed for him in ways people in love for years wouldn’t. But he couldn’t look past it and cannot seem to go back to his older self. Says he cannot treat me the way I deserve.

I don’t blame him. I just wish I could hug him and never let him go. But it’s over. And I have to make peace with that. I knew I was hard to love; he just made it very clear. That’s it.",1,2025-01-30 22:05:51,0,0.67,sashaxk
offmychest,1ids38o,What I learned,"I learned that some people wear a mask. When that mask comes off it can be ugly and cause embarrassment for not seeing it. 

I learned that men who say sexual things before meeting them in person and get to a second date, they are nothing but trouble 

I learned that no matter the sparks, the fireworks to be cautious because I can get dropped like a hot piece of coal. Quickly and without remorse.

I learned that explaining my feelings honestly and directly can cause the other person to be remorseful and think about things they said and did. 

I learned that both of us have grown from this experience 

I learned that forgiveness is really the only way. Not vengeance. Not retaliation. 

I learned that nothing has changed when it comes to poor behavior towards women by men being called out makes them very angry. They are mean. They want to retaliate. How dare someone tell anyone else that they have behaved in such a way. That you ripped their mask off. 

I learned that my focus was in the completely wrong direction. While I still believe that someone is out there for me, I'm not going to try so hard and I knew better the whole time. Now my focus is better directed and while I'm not perfect and still have my eyes open, things will be better. 

I learned that I can have difficult conversations without being emotional. This is a feat I have finally accomplished, especially when it comes to a romantic relationship. 

I learned that when someone throws shit at you, it's better to let it fall off and go shower. Give them no fodder. 

I learned that while I don't like being hated it is what it is. 

I learned that I'm also insanely stubborn about giving up on a person who is no good for me. 

I learned that I must change some things. I have always known that though. Work on progress. Always. ",2,2025-01-30 18:19:52,0,1.0,willtravel22

offmychest,1idlnmf,I miss me.,"I used to be a cheery extroverted girl who never saw darkness in anyone or anything. I used to constantly be happy and bouncy, willing to make friends with a squirrel. Ready to cheer up even a random old guy in a park (true story. 

You may think I changed just due to puberty or maturing, but I was this way up until last summer (I’m 18 for context). On June 18th 2024 I had my first seizure, then again in August, my third in October, and my most recent in December. I don’t blame the seizures entirely for my personality shift, but I do believe they’re a key part of it. Since I started having them I’ve been serious, tired, weak, depressed, cold, a loner. It’s like I’ve been replaced with the opposite of the old me. I asked my friends if they think I’ve changed and they of course tried to deny it to protect me, but one of them did say ‘You’re an adult now, that’s why you’re more real’. 

If this is real I don’t want it. I’m on antidepressants and have been going to therapy, but I’m still stuck as this strange new version of myself. I want to be the bubbly immature dumb cheery kid I was, not this new hollow serious adult. Maybe this is just me maturing, but I can’t stand it, I don’t want to grow up if this is how I’ll be for it.

I want to go back, to be ‘Wizzy’ again, not Isabelle.

offmychest,1idx1be,friend betrayed me,"When I was in 6th grade,( about 11years old) one of my classmates (lets call her Sarah, she was same age as me) asked me if I could sit with her and i agreed. Over the years she has become something like my bestfriend. We were talking the whole class and just whenever we would see each other. We were calling with each other almost every night before one of us had to go. At the beginning of 8th grade, she told me about having a huge crush on teacher which i did not think much of it and just sometimes teased her about it but nothing big. Also around this time I started writing my own story with my other friend and we started reading it to the teacher she had a crush on (he was in the story, but we never told him anything about her crush bcs we are not crazy so it was really just reading to him). At the begining of 2024 Sarah started telling me about her stories with that teacher. It started easily, like she just bumped into him or he waved at her, but than it started being more and more weird. Around March its was just of hand. For me the first ever time i started having questions about her stories was when he came to her house bcs her dad is working with wood and he wanted to order something. So after that day she knew his adress and when i asked her if its in some city bcs my grandma is living there Sarah said yes. But never showed me any proof or something. That was the time I remember just coming home with so much questions bcs wht are the odds? She was always bumping into him, whenever none of our friends were around it was always only her and the teacher. He told her that she could be a great doctor and that he can tutor her, but it was about a week after i told her i want to be a doctor. After a month it became even more crazier. She accidently texted one of our classmates (she also had a huge crush on him) on snapchat and he texted her back and in just a week they started dating. I remember her telling me that he sent her a heart emoji. After 4 days Sarah called me saying they are not together anymore. She was crying over the phone and it was just so sad. Also her and her 2 friends stopped talking which i was actually somehow happy bcs i knew they were super bad. So she was now friends just with me and my friends group. Around this time her little sister was also born and her dad somehow met the teacher and they became friends. So she told me that that teacher will be at her little sisters party (they were celebrating that she was born) Sarah also told us that he was super drunk there and was than dancing on street light. After that she started also writing story like me but it was about her and that teacher being together and when im thinking about it, it was really something. I was always telling her that she should not bring it to school or at least hide it from him, but she always opened it when we had a class with him. I hated that side of her bcs i knew, she is just doing it for him to notice, but i just kept ignoring it bcs i knew nobody is perfect. She was my almost bestfriend after all.

At the start of june we had a school trip with my class and that teacher Sarah had a crush on. I was just chilling and playing tennis with the teacher, when Sarah came to us and started talking about her little sister. Or she just mentioned her idk. So he asked her how old is her sister. At that moment everything came rushing at me back. Why would he asked about her little sisters age when about 3 moths ago he was celebrating her being born. I started asking everything about all of her stories but just kept it to myself. When it was time to go to bed i met that teacher before going to sleep and i asked him when its the last time he was drunk. HE told me its probably around 2 years ago. I cant even described the feeling i felt. It was like a super hard rock was just thrown into my stomach. I kept thinking about his worlds and just started to put it together with her stories. I even shared it with some of my closest friends and they agreed with me that its really weird. The school trip was 3 days long and i was in the same cabin as Sarah so it was hard playing friends with her even though I was sure she lied about everything. When the trip ended i wrote everything on a piece of paper at the first day i met her again i gave it to her. Before that i asked her is she has another stories and she told me some. (i just wanted to make sure she would lie to me again.) That paper had everything. There was all about how we knew that she and that classmate did not even talk to each other bcs he told me, that that teacher was never at her house, and he did not even know her dad, so he wasnt even at the celebration of her little sister and more and more. Also she once told us that the friends she stopped talking with were talking trashy about me and my friends. Which is bad but if you think about it she was with them so she was probabbly just quiet and did not say anything which is so disgusting of her. After that I told even about this situation to that teacher but just something, so he could be ready if the drunk stories or something would get famous around the school. What i did not know at the time was that he will tell it to our main teacher which was just bad bcs he wanted to know all that has happened and he even talked to Sarah. It was sooo crazy. About the next week Sarah gave me some piece of paper that has her apology on it saying she always loved my stories that has happened to me but she did not have anything to tell us so she lied. From some point i get that but also i love spending time with her even without some of hers exciting stories that were just straight up lies.

Now its more than 6 months and we are in 9th grade. She started talking with those 2 girls and got worse or at least i think. I dont remember her being that egoistic. We dont talk anymore which i dont know if im happy or not. Like she was my best friend(almost) and i really felt good around her, but also i dont think i would be happy being around her when i know she lied to me for half a year. We are still sitting next to each other bcs somehow everybody knows what has happened (they dont have it from me). I hate her for what she has done to me and i dont know if i can ever trust somebody like i trusted people before this. I want to move on and let her be, but i just cant. There isnt a day that i didnt think about her betrayal. Its slowly eating me inside.

i hope there is something to do to move on. Sorry for my bad english or long text but its just so crazy story for me that i cant make it any shorter. Hope i didnt missed anything important. I wanted to write this to tell people that this can happen and also im asking for help. I tried everything to move on but i just cant. Whenever i see her i want to slap her right in the face. Please if u have anything that can help tell me im open to anything. (also sending love and support to everyone going through this <3)

TL;DR: My friend that i was almost bestfriends from 6th to 8th grade has been lying to me for at least 6 months about meeting our teacher when he was drunk, or that he visited her at her house to order something at her dads and they became friends so he was coming to her house whenever they were celebrating something, or that she was dating our classmate which was not true. I found out on my own and her excuse was just that my stories were just so good and she didnt have anything to share so she made all of this up. Now i dont know how to get over it even though it happened in june 2024. If you want more details you can read all of the above.",1,2025-01-30 21:45:35,0,1.0,barunka0001
offmychest,1idwmes,I’m so sick of everything and adults thinking they “understand”. SH trigger?,"I’m so sick of sitting in class for 8 hours, doing work on my computer like I’m nothing.

Like just another kid, cause that’s what we’re supposed to do??

I listen to music in one ear on my AirPods all the time and it’s supposed to help but it just becomes more depressing.

All those artists, poets, free spirits effecting the world, actually doing something while I learn about language I know fluently.

They are so free, I’m watching lives all the time and I want to be free like them so bad.

My dad is supposed to be my best friend.

That’s what I know. But he just doesn’t listen to me at all lately and is starting to act like I’m the kid and he’s the parent, but he never acted like that.

My opinion is supposed to matter, why doesn’t it now?

Why, cause he’s not used to me finally acting like a person with opinions and not like that little girl who praised him and agreed with everything he did?

My mom wants to help but she doesn’t really.

She also told me “we are the parents, you are the student, so it’s our opinion about school that matters”

I told about this to my aunt and even she was surprised she said that.

I don’t know what’s going on.

I hate everything.

I think about SH so much more lately.

I don’t want to go back there but I’m scared of myself.

offmychest,1idwl9w,My ex is awaiting charges for attempted murder or murder,"Last night there was a police hunt for a subject who assaulted someone near my house.

We locked the doors and stayed inside.

Drones, cop cars, streets being blocked off.

Went to bed.

Woke up this morning and was reading more about what happened. Putting all these little bits of info together, i started getting suspicious….turns out my ex attacked his step dad while in a meth rage. He stopped breathing at the scene but is currently in the icu.

My ex was found in the backyard of a home he broke into 3 years ago chopping wood. 

I haven’t been in contact with my ex for probably 10+ years. He was always shy and quiet. Never saw this coming. (We had a teenage relationship that lasted over the course of a year.)

His family says that drugs turned him into a monster who has psychosis from years of drug use.

Praying for healing for everyone involved.

offmychest,1idwkbr,i don’t know what I’m doing with my life,"I’ve been in university for 5 years now and still haven’t graduated. I work for my parents at a job I never liked or wanted to do. But I feel obligated because they pay me enough and I’m their eldest daughter. I’m constantly being nagged at for not working myself to the bone for their company. If I’m not at school I have to be working at their office that’s 45 minutes away. I also do sports and I’m in a leadership position which also requires much of my time. I have to manage the team. There’s issues with other leadership which I have to stand up against and protect my people. I can never seem to get my grades above a C even though I know all the material. I have no motivation to go to class and do my assignments. My house is always a mess, there’s always a pile of dishes, laundry is always backed up, my boyfriend’s dog always pees inside the house so it always smells, and I’m tired. Tired of living, tired of cleaning with no progress, tired of being responsible for other people, tired of always having to be the best, tired of never being able to take a day to myself in fear of being scolded by my parents, tired of not having any sort of motivation to do anything. I just want to sleep and not have to wake up for a while. I want a normal life where my parents aren’t the emotionally abusive and controlling people they are even now that I’m moved out and “on my own”. I ran out because I was sick of them.

offmychest,1idwh9a,I'm struggling and processing my addiction,"People say you can't get addicted to cannabis, but you can. Growing a dependence is addiction, and this is where I am right now. I just got dumped and while I agree with all the reasons we broke up, it was more of the blow to my ego because he was only driven to love my body, not who I actually am. My mom is waiting to get a hysterotomy for a biopsy, so she might have cancer. I have an autoimmune disease that's kicking my ass, my mental illness has been driven into the ground, and I'm so broke but I'm physically and mentally unable to work more. After all this, I thought my anxiety was because I was taking edibles/smoking regularly. I've been a month sober from weed, and have only drank twice. I'm fighting the urge DAILY to purchase more cannabis. I'm still as anxious as I was, and I don't see the point of being sober if that was my primary reason to stop besides bragging rights. But at the same time, if I stay sober, in a few months, I can actually be proud of myself about such an accomplishment. I've also been embarrassed for even mention how often I was high, and realized I can't be proud of myself if I keep feeling embarrassed about something I'm actively taking part in. I'm not trying to judge other people, just I know weed isn't my thing, but it was so easy to forget the world while I was high.

offmychest,1idwdq1,Been having feelings lately,"This might be a little long/convoluted so bare with me here. Also, I apologise for any grammatical errors or any potential repetition beforehand. 


I'm at one of those points in life where people are drifting and changing, slowly but surely. Some people around me have been finding themselves significant others and I couldn't be happier for them, but recently I've just been feeling a bit lonely. I don't talk very much, it's not that I don't want to talk, it's just that the people around me have so much that they want to say and I don't want to upset them, plus I don't necessarily have the most important things to talk about. But seeing people have partners or just friends who care for them, who listen and reassure eachother, it's just made me feel so much more alone. I don't think that many of my friends would be very good at listening or symphathising (there are some, but only one or two). I'm the person who's called on for relationship or mental health advice, I'm *always* the one giving help. Don't get me wrong, I love helping people, it makes me feel useful and like a good person. But despite all that, despite wanting to help and wanting to care, I struggle with attachment in the way that I don't get attached enough, if you know what I mean. I would be sad if something happened to my friends or family but it wouldn't really affect me hugely. It's made me feel selfish in some way and has started to make me think that maybe I'll never be able to care for someone the way that they deserve, as much as I might want to.

So basically, I've been having feelings lately, it happens sometimes, hopefully it won't stick around and weigh me down for too long but who knows. I just really needed to get it out somewhere. I hope that one day I find someone who will care, respect, listen to me and just be close to me, someone who I can do that for too. It doesn't have to be a relationship, I just really hope that one day I'll feel less lonely, that one day I'll have someone too.",1,2025-01-30 21:17:21,0,1.0,Some_Human1735
offmychest,1idw9ct,Consider that other people love each other on reddit,"In many posts on this sub and other similar ones, I think many people are quick to jump from their own trauma understanding of the situation to equate their own experience of abuse to a poster's. But almost always the poster only talks about the bad things their partner did and leaves out the whole context and love of their relationship that no one is going to see. So the whole economy is posts is biased and skewed because no one is considering why they are together in the first place. 

We're like children of divorce that forgot their parents had ever loved each other in the first place, so we just believe that others are going through the same trauma and to save them pain they need to get out. 

But we shouldn't always run away from pain. Some relationship struggle is necessary. Of course there is a threshold to what should be tolerated, but for many people that's very low especially considering that they don't know the whole scope of why the couple loves each other, or how they converse, or how they treat each other. 

Personally every time I fight with my partner I see it as an opportunity to be gentle with them, to foster empathy, to see where my ego is taking up all the defensiveness space, and to surrender my position because I love and respect her. Disagreements, fights, throwing shots, are all opportunities to create respect for each other. 

Many misunderstandings can be resolved by instead of saying ""You did this, I'm hurting, be accountable"" and them taking it as ""You hurt me, you suck, I don't want to be with you"". That's your new opp (opponent)

You can say ""I am feeling this feeling and I'd like your help understanding it"" and then it's not war, it's actual gentle love and flexing the unwritten rule that we're supposed to care for each others emotions in a relationship",1,2025-01-30 21:12:16,0,1.0,TastyShelter

The doors stay closed during lunch hours which is an understandably courteous move, but whenever I open them, I see the same people taking up most of the table gossiping with each other. I always feel like I’m walking into a meeting and interrupting them. It doesn’t help that this table is also right next to the fridge and microwave where I could literally turn around and bump into them.

offmychest,1idqkv4,To those Smashburger Workers,"On Tuesday i went to smashburger because I wanted something to drink so I ordered a 20oz cup for some Dr Pepper. boy do i love me some Dr Pepper 

Anyways, at the lids and straws section thingy (right where the soda fountain is) I only saw the 30oz lids on the lid holder or whatever you call it. The thing is, the lid holder thing had a little divider in the middle. The top half had the 30z label so naturally i assumed the LABELESS bottom half had the 20oz BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ANY OTHER LID HOLDERS NEARBY

So I take a lid from the BOTTOM half and placed it on my cup. It didn't clip. What the fuck. I threw it out, and took another lid. Didn't clip. Threw it out. Took another one. Didn't clip. I realized I was wasting too much so i pretended like it did fit.

I couldn't tell if this was my social anxiety, but I swear i could feel the workers staring at me. Was too embarrassed to check

As I walk to the other end of the counter thing to grab my straw, THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE 20oz LIDS !!!!2$/&/&-&:&;&3 AAAAAAAAA

I quickly took one and ran out, I was way too embarrassed. I thought they wouldn't see me. So I stood in front of the trashcan outside to throw out the old big ass lid. But i was struggling because I had already put the straw in and I DO NOT HAVE THREE HANDS

I had to bite down on the new lid to get rid of the old one. Even then, the paper straw refused to get out and i almost spilled my drink, my Diet Dr Kelp. This happened at night. In the middle of Manhattan. I don't know if this was my social anxiety but i swear everyone within 5 kilometers wanted to call me a fucking idiot

I did this outside because I didn't want the workers to see me realize and fix my mistake, but then I realized that Smashburger had big ass windows so they probably saw me struggle more than I should've

So to the Smashburger workers, I'm sorry if you had to see all of that. It's been two days and I'm still beating myself up over this, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I hope when I left, you and your coworkers didn't spend too much time laughing at me. I'm really sorry.",2,2025-01-30 17:16:46,0,1.0,RitzoniteThe2nd
offmychest,1idw0gg,Joined a group on here for advice from older people… why is everyone so angry?,"I originally joined hoping for genuine advice from people who have lived more life—neutral, thoughtful guidance from those with experience. But after posting a couple of times, I’ve realized that most responses aren’t actually advice; they’re just harsh, cold, and filled with anger. Instead of offering wisdom, many people jump straight to telling you how crazy or wrong you are, sometimes outright mocking the question.

And before anyone says, “You asked for advice, but it seems like you just want to argue,”—no, that’s not the case. I want to hear different perspectives; that’s literally why I asked. But there’s a difference between sharing an opinion and just unloading bitterness onto someone, and a lot of the responses here cross that line. When someone clarifies their thoughts, that’s not “arguing”—it’s a conversation. But the way some people react, it’s as if asking a question is an invitation to be attacked, not advised.

My questions haven’t even been anything wild, yet the tone of responses makes it seem like I committed some huge offense just by seeking perspective. And it’s not just my posts—reading through other threads, I see the same pattern. Even when someone is simply trying to do something kind (like my own), the reaction is often laced with hostility rather than actual guidance.

And honestly? It just makes me feel sad for them. If getting older means becoming this angry and unwilling to actually help people understand, then that’s depressing. That’s not how you get people to listen or learn—it just makes them tune you out. You’d think life experience would make people more patient and understanding, not more bitter and dismissive.

I get that sometimes the “hard truth” is necessary, but a lot of responses here aren’t that—they’re just people venting their frustrations or getting mad for no reason. It makes me wonder: Does aging naturally harden people’s hearts, or is it just certain corners of the internet that bring out this energy? Because if this is what “wisdom” looks like, I’d rather hold onto kindness.",0,2025-01-30 21:02:10,2,0.5,Beneficial_Candy1517
offmychest,1idvxr8,Finally i’m happy,"For most of my adult life i’ve had my fair share of relationships and friendships most of my friends stuck around but never my relationships. I was feeling depressed i felt like i was gonna be forever alone. In my past relationships i was always the one to initiate conversations/plan everything but those plans never materialized so those relationships went nowhere and i always felt unloved by my exes. At the end of 2024 i found out my job is closing and getting my severance which made me a little scared of what’s in store next. Then exactly 2 days into 2025 i thought why not let me try facebook dating and see what’s out there. It was a big step for me because i rarely put myself out there in dating apps/sites before. As i was scrolling I found this cute girl with similar interests and lives about an hour or so away from me so i clicked like thinking i’ll never get a match back because im not the best look dude out there and i don’t have my license yet at 32 because i had other responsibilities to take care of. Then out of the blue she matched with me and we started talking, getting to know each other and this girl is truly special. She is smart, caring, honest, genuine, loving, trustworthy, understanding of my home/work and driving situation, someone i can be myself around, i can talk to about anything, allow me to make her picture my lock screen on my phone and the only person that can make me smile even when what’s left of my work gets hectic. I have never i mean NEVER felt this happy to talk with/about a girl before she actually thinks about me and makes me feel like i am a human being and with her situation she actually made an effort to get some privacy and FaceTime me. We talked for 2 hours about anything and everything it was great. I have never been this excited to date a girl as wonderful as her. Sex hasn’t been brought up once. She’s special in every sense of the word. She makes me feel like life is worth living. She’s someone i can see myself marrying one day and that’s my goal.

offmychest,1idvu8q,My lifelong friend (F 21) doesn't give me the time of day because of toxic POS boyfriend,"So, let me preface this by saying I am in no way judging her for what she's going through.

Starting off, my friend and I have been very close for almost our whole lives. She's always been rocky and on-off with guys since high school. Since she's been to uni, she met this guy (a year younger) who has quite literally changed her into a different person and ruined her life. He's physical with her, verbally abusive, has cheated on her by fucking other girls, and has screamed and yelled at her for crying. He is the definition of a piece of shit. Not that this matters, but he is Muslim which I've heard only bad things about (not gonna lie) and she knows that as well. All of her friends have told her to RUN as fast as she can away from this guy because he's trouble. He sells drugs, he takes pills, he refuses to share his location with her (even tho she shares with him) and he won't let her out of the house to do anything.

I have been there for her and have been helping her the past two years she's been with this loser, and every time I have understood that she loves him and this and that, but it's getting out of hand. I myself have a boyfriend of almost 3 years, and I am in a very healthy and happy relationship. I can't necessarily relate to her issues, but I have dealt with my fair share of ""piece of shit"" guys like him.

This post is generally to ask for advice on what I should do. She doesn't talk to me unless things are really bad with him (they're fighting or whatnot). However, when things are going well in her life, she doesn't bother reaching out to me or asking how my life is or how my boyfriend is. Instead, she just doesn't talk to me unless she needs help or advice. And every time, I am still there for her because I care about her and I am genuinely scared for her and her safety. Debated calling the cops on him because he's that big of a piece of shit. She never asks to hangout. She doesn't bother with me unless she needs me. I get that we don't need to talk every day (or week for that matter) but it's been almost a month and she hasn't even texted me, I have texted twice asking how she is and she is dry and just says good. I almost wish he just broke up with her and left her alone (FOR GOOD) because thats the only way they will end. She is very weak-minded and is desperate for him. He doesn't love her.

offmychest,1icrvym,"My fiancé cheated on me while on a work trip, I’m 35 weeks pregnant.","Using a throw away for obvious reasons. 

I had a feeling something wasn’t right when I went to use his computer while he was gone and the pin was changed. I tried all the usual pins we have and it locked me out. I didn’t ask him for the new pin. 

He came home from his 5 day trip and I could tell he was exhausted and jet lagged but he still didn’t seem like happy to see me? You know how when you just know you know? Anyways we went to sleep cause it was around midnight when he got home. I woke up around 5 (thanks pregnancy for making me go pee at all hours) and decided to take his phone into the bathroom and have a look. I have never felt the urge to do this before. To my surprise his phone pin didn’t change. So I check the socials, IG, Facebook messenger, all normal. I check what apps he has downloaded, nothing out of the ordinary. I’m like ok ok maybe I was wrong. Then I go into his emails. 

PayPal receipt, he sent someone (a man’s name) $150 with a description 1st payment for suite. I’m like huh work paid for all his expenses. I dive deeper. I go into his google account activity. App used: grindr. App used: Snapchat. App used: secure folder. My fucking heart sinks into my stomach. We don’t use Snapchat we are in our mid thirties. I tried finding the folder but not that great with Samsung phones so I give up. I close everything and go back to bedroom and put his phone back. Got a drink of water and came back up to bed. He’s awake and says baby what’s wrong I say nothing go back to sleep. He’s like just tell me what’s wrong. I said why don’t you tell me? What could I possibly be upset about? He goes what did I do? I’m like I think you already know. 

I unload and I ask him questions and he just agrees with everything I ask. You fucked someone? Yes. A dude? Yes. You paid for it? Yes. Like just sat there and nodded his head yes to it all. I’m crying at this point, devastated. We had a miscarriage almost three years ago and have been trying to get pregnant again since, and here I am almost ready to pop and he does this shit. I always had a feeling he was bi since he was into butt stuff and pegging. I never liked it but I just wanted him to be happy. We haven’t been intimate like at all lately because I’ve been uncomfortable with my pregnant body and just wasn’t into anything right now. He assured me he only wanted to be pegged by me, he wasn’t gay, and he would never let a man touch him. Ok cool lots of straight men are into pegging, whatever right? lol.  

Anyways, I go to work, confused and sad af. He goes to work. We don’t talk much of the day. We coordinate about the dog. He comes home to grab shit to take to his parents to stay there and he goes I never actually followed through with anything I was going to go meet up with someone but I stopped myself. I’m like that’s bullshit. He throws his phone on the bed at me and says look at my location history I was at my hotel the whole time. I’m like dude you can delete locations that means nothing to me. You should have showed me this morning before getting a chance to wipe your phone all day. His story keeps changing, it wasn’t a man, it was a trans woman, they sent photos of each other and planned to meet up, he paid half up front and was going to pay the other half after..like just saying anything he could to make this “less bad”. 

So now I have all the conflicting information, but I’ll never know what actually happened. I don’t know what to believe except that he will continue doing this and just get better at hiding. He wants to be there when the babies born. I mean fine but we had plans to raise our baby together and now I have to share him with him? I’m so hurt and confused and lost. I didn’t want this. He was so so loving to me and I didn’t see this coming at all. He gave me no reasons to suspect anything in the five years we’ve been together. Our wedding was supposed to be September 13rh this year. Luckily we’re only losing the venue deposit. 

He says he loves me and he’s sorry and it’ll never happen again and I just don’t believe any of it. I lost everything so he could have a good time with a stranger. ",378,2025-01-29 12:41:21,55,0.97,throwaway8374827
offmychest,1idvsrv,This girl is driving me nuts,"I met this girl at a party early September. Our sister were friends so that's How I started to talk to her. We hit it off quite well and she kept saying we had to go out and do something. When I got back home I saw she added me on snap and sent a snap. We started snapping regularly but she never showed her face.( I knew she was somewhat shy). Her mum began to text my mum about us doing something like a dog walk or economics conference but my mum was cockblocking saying no, as she thought she was a weird girl. We have had a snap streak and both of us have started the occasional convo but each of them were dry and she never really tried to continue the conversation. Apart from one where I sent her a snap of me playing f1 24. She asked me if I was into f1 and we had a small convo and it turns out we both were ferrari fans. She tried to keep it going like once or twice but that was it. She didn't try in any further conversations. Her snaps before were quite consistent being about every 3hrs. But a few weeks ago she started showing parts of her face and some parts of her chest (fully clothed of course). Around 4 days after that her snaps slowed and became very inconsistent. I sent her a text saying ""Hey when we doing this dog walk our mums been chatting"" she responded with ""has she now, idk ill ask her when I get back"". I hoped it would start us doing something but I havnt got anything back. Her snaps have slowed but still showing parts of her face and chest. 

This girl has made me feel a roller coaster of emotions. The most excited moments thinking I have made progress. And arguably the lowest I ever have been. Especially today when I am begging to lose hope as she is leaving me on delivered for way too long and convos going dry. 

I keep over thinking everything. My mind is saying that she was just drunk and was only flirting with me because of that and now she knows what I look like isn't showing interest.
I really don't get it as I thought I'd have a shot as apparently she doesn't have a huge amount of friends and I am not exactly an ugly guy if I'm being honest. I'm 6'4 (193cm), blonde hair, not fat but not jacked. and people keep saying girls will fall at my feet which I am just not seeing.

This is the first time since I've reached above the age of 15 a girl I thought has shown interest in me and that I have a shot but I don't know. My best friend says I cannot give up. But my other friend who has far more knowledge in this area (aka women) says I need to leave it. 

I really don't know what to do and I think I just need to get this off my chest. I know some people have actual issues on here and mine is dwarfed by them but I just needed a place to rant.

If anyone reads this, thanks for listening and any advice someone could give would be appreciated.

offmychest,1idvkjo,Is it in my head?,"For context Im 21F and adopted I would not say Im super attractive but not ugly and normal looking. 
I would say my body is Very developed if you know what I mean skinny hourglass figure.
I just saw my uncle ( Dad sister’s husband ) for family gathering and he made a comment how I was beautiful then proceed to look me up and down and give me a look and I just shrugged it off and said thank you to not make it into more. He then asked me If I heard him and I said yes thank you again then quickly turned my attention to other things. 
I spent a summer with my aunty and uncle when I was around 12 and my body growing like a normal teenager and that’s when the weird looks started. 
I would be doing anything or eating dinner and he would give looks to my growing body. I felt weird at the time but I was too young to realize. Nothing ever happened just these weird things. Over the years as i grew up he would make more comments on my looks ever time he saw me calling me attractive etc and giving me a look. I feel as though the older I get it becomes worse the bolder he says it when I happen to visit them and he does these things right infront of my aunt and I do not know whether she sees it. Same goes with my dad. 
One summer on vacation with extended family a few of my uncles and grandfather got drunk and were sitting outside drinking I don’t remember why I went to check on them but I did and they sort of gave me looks and was even borderline flirting with me the short time till I was uncomfortable enough to leave. ( I was maybe 15 at the time.) 
My memory is pretty good but I just can’t remember details I feel as though I have repressed these memories. 
Im at a bit of a loss to what to feel, Is it because i look different from the rest of my relatives because Im adopted? Or is it because Im more developed? Or is it all in my head which i dont think it is with how uncomfortable i feel.

offmychest,1idvhh1,Any married person going through this?,"My goodness! 
Where do I start? 
Anyone who is married dealing with someone that is not humbled at all or is it just me?
We come from poverty but he complains so much about everything and everyone.
It’s exhausting because my spouse expects things to be done for him. To be his way and to be at his time. He hates when there’s no money and complains that it’s the bills, but in all reality it was just him not paying his bills when younger and now him having to pay his past dues. He doesn’t give me or my children money. I have to do uber eats with him to have money throughout the week to have just in case when taking my kids to therapy.
We live with my family and we pay 560 of rent and 200 aside because he didn’t pay 8 months rent. It’s so out of hand how behind he is. I don’t work because we have two kids with autism so while he’s in school and work I’m at my kids therapies. I put a stop to my education but I’m going back this year to finish because I can’t be going on like this. My kids and I deserve better.

offmychest,1idptqm,I can’t be there for my suicidal friend anymore,"One of my friends is going through severe depression. A lot of unfortunate things have happened to him over the past few years and he’s hit rock bottom. Sadly, he’s gotten to the point of becoming suicidal and completely given up on life. 

He says we won’t make it to February. 

He already tried it a little over a year ago. Took some pills and ended up in the hospital for days. 

He’s been to therapy, but since he’s told something he doesn’t want to hear, he drops it. He’s been on meds, but doesn’t follow through his treatments and checkouts. His family has arranged for doctors to visit him and talk to him at home, but he won’t cooperate. We’ve tried keeping him company, making plans, keeping in touch, but it doesn’t help. His family was going to admit him to a clinic this week to prevent him harming himself, but he found out and ran away from home. He went back the next day.

I have a history of depression and anxiety myself. All this situation has overwhelmed me. Reading his texts, talking to him and even seeing him has become draining and detrimental to my own mental health. He’s been wanting to talk to me on the phone for a few days but I’ve avoided him, because I know he’s wants to ‘say goodbye’, ask me to be at his funeral (he has texted it before), telling me he’s scared of what happens next. But even if he wasn’t and he just wanted to vent, I couldn’t dealt with that either. I’m overwhelmed with this situation.

 I’ve talked to my therapist and been told that setting boundaries for my own good is not only ok, but necessary at this point. That whatever he ends up doing, is not my responsibility or fault. That no magic words from me or his other friends exist to help him in the state he’s currently in. 

Yesterday, he texted me again wanting to call. I didn’t reply. I want to tell him that I don’t want to talk to him anymore and that at this moment I can’t be there for him either. But I’m terrified that I might aggravate his situation and cause him more pain, especially since February is now so close.

offmychest,1icmj5f,A comment I left on another post made me realize I need to say this out loud,"I left a comment on another post earlier today, and the more I think about it, the more I realize it’s something I need to say to more of you. Maybe it will resonate, maybe it will spark a conversation, or maybe I just need to get it off my chest.

I’m watching what’s happening right now with the ICE raids and mass deportations in the U.S., and I can’t shake this feeling of dread. Not just because of what’s happening, but because of how it’s being framed, how the language around it is being manipulated, and how people are being conditioned to accept it.

The far right has mastered coded language. When they talk about “law and order,” “border security,” or “protecting American jobs,” they aren’t really making policy arguments, but rather, laying the groundwork for mass removals of minorities. It starts with “criminals” and “illegal immigrants” and has already escalated beyond this, with innocent people getting snatched up for no reason. 

They’re tapping into the real fear and suffering that people are experiencing under late-stage capitalism (rising costs, job insecurity, housing instability) and they’re giving them a scapegoat. Instead of putting the blame on the people who actually deserve it, like the billionaires hoarding wealth or the corporations squeezing every last drop out of workers, they’re pointing their fingers at the immigrants. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

They’ve already built a narrative that justifies these mass deportations. Elon Musk, for example, has spent years telling people that immigration itself is an existential threat, that migrants are here to “replace” them, that policies protecting refugees are a form of “anti-white discrimination.” It’s the same argument he’s using against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The idea goes: DEI policies “judge white men by their group identity,” just as Jews were judged by theirs. It’s a blatant, twisted false equivalency, but it’s being used to make white Americans feel like victims of the same historical injustices that were committed against marginalized groups. It reframes any policy that promotes equity as an attack. And once people believe they are under attack, they will justify almost anything in response. Just look at any comment section of Selena Gomez’s recent video and you’ll see how bad it’s gotten. 

But THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS. This is how mass purges begin. Not all at once, but step by step, under the guise of “law and order,” through rhetoric that makes the unacceptable seem reasonable. PEOPLE ARE BEING RIPPED FROM THEIR HOMES and deported en masse, and there are people cheering it on because they’ve been made to believe that these removals are necessary, even just.

I know a lot of people are struggling right now. I know it’s easy to want to blame something or someone for how hard life has become. But this isn’t the answer. Mass deportations won’t make housing more affordable. They won’t raise wages. They won’t stop corporations from exploiting workers or billionaires from evading taxes. They won’t fix the system crushing all of us.

I just needed to say this out loud. Maybe some of you feel the same way. Maybe some of you have been watching this unfold and feeling that same pit in your stomach. If you do, I hope you know you’re not alone.",1070,2025-01-29 06:16:17,51,0.96,This_Phase3861
offmychest,1iduok3,I cheated throughout a lot of high school and I'm starting to think it might be too late to save myself.,"it is what it says. originally i just did a bit of against-the-rules calculating for math because i had always struggled with math, and no matter how hard i studied there were some things i couldnt wrap my head around. but then i realized how easy and quick it was to get through everything when i just looked up all the answers. then i started frauding my way through every subject except one (because i excelled at it my entire life and had no need to.) even though i think i couldve just learned normally.

 i know cheating is common and most people dont experience major consequences, but im starting to worry i've trained myself into becoming an idiot, and that someone might find out somehow and it'll be over for me.

can i undo this? theres no going back on what ive already faked, but i do want to stop cheating for whats left, and stop being stupid. i dont intend to go to college or get into any careers where ignorance is dangerous, but.. i just feel like i've ruined something forever, somehow. is it possible to unlearn learned helplessness? am i just catastrophizing?

offmychest,1idum18,I was violent with my mother and I have to live with it,"I (25m) has grabbed my mother's (61f) arm and forced her into an armchair a year and half ago.

Backstory: the period in my life that I'm going to describe was plagued by great strife. I was doing my master thesis at the time, and my advisor didn't provide most of the things necessary for the assignment which he promised. I had to try and negotiate with a lab in another university, I had to help broker a partnership deal between our unis, I had to conduct a massive experiment in a short timescale, and I had to pay for the expenses out of my and my mother's pockets (I was reimbursed half a year later).

Because of the reasons described in the previous paragraph I was struggling to finish my thesis in time. In fact, I got final data two days before the preliminary defense, processed it a day before the preliminary defense, and finished my thesis a day before the deadline.

Two days before the things describes in the first paragraph happened, I was talking to my mother saying that I hardly can finish it in time and probably will have to graduate the next year. My mother just responded with, 'So what? You'll defend it the next year then!' Just like that I was disenfranchised in my mother and lost much of my respect for her.

Two days forward, I managed to finish my thesis by then, was pretty tired as I haven't slept in days. But I still needed to contact a print shop to get a printed copies of my thesis. I can't say that I exactly stalling with it, I filled the appropriate online form in a heartbeat, but sleep was one of my priorities back then. So they should have contacted us back, but there is nothing in my inbox. I think that they might contact us later and go to sleep, but my mother constantly nags me, going around how I must have did something wrong, basically mocking me for my ineptitude. Her attitude made me pretty angry already.

Then I check the form again, find out that I made a typo with my email, tell my mother about this, and she responds with, 'So? What did you expect' in a really mocking and belittling tone. That was the moment I snapped and did the actions I described in the first paragraph.

Aftermath: contrary to my expectations, my mother didn't hold a grudge at all. Walking in 10 minutes later asking about my progress with getting the prints. She even went to them to get these copies while I could get some sleep. The fact that my mother in fact was helping me with my thesis (even if it was mainly giving money for it and a small favor like this) make it all even worse.

A year and half later I develop conscience and sit here with the horror of what I've done. I apologized to her for this some time ago, but she just doesn't recall the occurrence at all. The shame I feel is paralyzing, I can't act or think straight. My work is significantly impaired because of this. I struggle with finding a reason to move on, seeing what a terrible human being I turned out to be.

Extra info: to make it worse, it wasn't the first time I exerted physical violence towards my mother. The last time before it was at 15 years of age when I punched her lower back for trying to get my underpants from the attic despite my protests to wearing them.

The first time was at 9 years old when she spilled a soup over me. I was angry, but wasn't going to act physically abusive towards her. But then she literally begs me to hit me with, 'Hit me! Come on! Hit me for what I have done!' in a genuine and not at all sarcastic tone. I do not make this up. I proceeded with punching her in face. Then she immidiately turns angry towards me, calls me a slur, and through the following week tells me how I should live in an orhanage.

I also exerted physical violence against my father when I was 17 although I don't feel as guilty about this. The story is that my father came home drunk, bragging about how he could land a good part time job in a local factory when being my age. I just remarked that it has more to do with the fact that the factory didn't went bankrupt back then and overall economy was better in a friendly manner. In response he started to call me a moron and tapped his fingers on my forehead in a rude manner. I was shocked with this kind of treatment which was totally uncalled for. I went to my room overflowing with rage, thinking how a person that's supposed to be my father is no better than the guys who bullied me at school. I was on the fence about going to parents' room and beating his ass. I decided against it. It was when he came to my room acting all friendly and pretending that his flabbergasting treatment of me didn't happen minutes ago when I snapped. I punched his face. He punched mine without holding back in response. It messed up my jaw in some way. Way in middle school he already tried to kick my ass (literally) when I called him out on senseless drinking, but he missed by an inch. And not long ago I learned that he gave me a black eye back in middle school. Despite all of what I described I understand that I should not have resorted to physical violence in this case either.

My shame is immense and my sins are innumerable. I don't and I don't think I'll ever will ask for forgiveness not do I need it. It doesn't stop me from apologizing as the intent behind it is different. If someone would propose a duel of sorts to fight on my mother's behalf I would accept the challenge. I'm sorry that your and society's souls have to be poisoned with my darkness. Please write below if my death would be beneficial for humanity's sake. Thank you for bearing with me.

Tl;dr: I grabbed my mother's arm and forced her into an armchair and am overwhelmed by guilt.",1,2025-01-30 20:04:04,0,1.0,CheckJaded
offmychest,1idujbd,Lost a bestfriend recently,"Recently my best friend and I had a huge falling out. For months I felt like she was avoiding me and last week I decided to call her out on it. For context whenever I invite her to hangout she either ignores my texts or she cancels last minute. She constantly posts on social media about hanging out with mutual friends and her dates with her boyfriend. I tried to understand that maybe she was just busy and didn't have time, but my overthinking got to me. I told her that we needed to talk and told her about how I felt she was avoiding me and why she couldn't make time for me when she clearly has time for others. 

Basically she ranted to me that she resented me since high-school (we both are currently in our last year of college) and that she has been avoiding me on purpose. She says that she hasn't put in effort because she felt I wasn't. That confused me because I was always the one asking to hangout never her. She hates my humor, she thinks I'm too negative, I never put in effort, she hates the way I handle situations, and she hates me. Clearly we aren't friends anymore and perhaps we never were to begin with I guess. I apologized to her and ended the friendship.

I have her blocked along with mutuals. I was never close to them and never hungout, but they probably hate me as well. I have been trying to keep her out of sight out of mind but it's not working. I have no other friends to go to. I only have family and my boyfriend now. I feel miserable ever since the fight. How do I forget about her and regain my confidence?

offmychest,1iduj8d,I was told 2 days before the end of my fixed-term contract that I have to go.,"Hey so I know, there is basically nothing I can do but yesterday, my world broke down and I just have to tell somebody who doesn’t know me, doesn’t know the people around.
So this is my 2nd workspace, I am at the beginning of my 20s. I am working in a lab. I decided to leave my old workplace because I didn’t want to stay in the big city and go back to the countryside. I got lucky and quickly found the place where I am currently (well not anymore) working. I was told and this is also the way it was written out online, that this will eventually be a permanent employment. It is not uncommon to get a few months fixed-term, in case something really doesn’t work out, I knew this. But nobody ever told me that I might not get this permanent employment. Okay so I started working, I was really happy with the job, the people, everything. It was basically perfect. After me, there came another person. Which was odd because technically, with me, we were full. But the highest manager wanted to have this person, even though everyone told him we are full. So well, now there were 2 new people. And shortly after that, we heard for the first time, that we are too many people. And someone has to go. The lab manager even told him a name of a person who has to go & he said that this person would be the one. Nothing else was ever said. Well, tomorrow, my fixed-term contract ends. And on tuesday, the highest manager told my lab manager that he will not terminate this other person and that somebody of us new ones has to go. And he should tell who it would be - which he didn‘t do because this is not what they agreed on. Well and the highest manager chose me because I live further away. I only got compliments in there, I did nothing wrong. The person who originally had to go did do a lot of shit, though. And even though we tried, nothing changed his mind. And he told me 2 days before the ending of this contract. I didn‘t even have the time to think about where I wanna go now. There aren’t that many options where I live. And I really didn’t want to go anymore. I just enjoyed it there. I liked the people. I cried so much already. There is nothing I can do. I tried, I got another month at least so I can get my money and meanwhile find a new job. But in the end, it is still me who has to go. Even though I didn’t do anything wrond and even though I was the one who came before. There wasn’t even a job advertisement anymore when he decided that the other one should come, too. This is how life is, I guess, not fair. Lesson learned. My team doesn’t want to give up because they really want to keep me, they are also devastated especially my lab manager. But what if the highest manager now really says „okay you can stay“? My trust is still gone. And he still would have the option to kick me out a month later and then I REALLY have nothing to argue anymore because I received every possibility. I am sorry for the long post, I am just beyond devastated. I told them so many times that I am so happy to be here, that I was afraid I wouldn’t find another nice team like the one I had at my first job but I was lucky again and now they take it away from me.

offmychest,1idowhs,Let me share my story as I'm more demotivated than ever...,"See let me clarify first, I am M15. I don’t know what to say. And maybe that’s the saddest part of all.

Today, I walked into a class for something—just a simple meeting, nothing grand, nothing extraordinary. But behind my back, they whispered, they laughed, they branded me with a label I never asked for. “Gay,” they called me. And I tell you, it wasn’t the word itself that stung. It was the way they said it—the mockery, the sneers, the sheer pleasure they took in tearing me down. You’d think a heart like mine would be made of stone by now, but it isn’t. No, sir. It’s still as breakable as a windowpane in a hailstorm. And today, it shattered again. Now, don’t get me wrong. I know what they’ll say—“Be mature, ignore them, rise above it.” And by all means, I would, if I could. But let me tell you something about the back of a man’s heart. It’s where the truth lives, and my truth is this—I am insecure as hell. I am short. But I think—no, I hope—I look good too. And yet, when words like these are thrown at me, I start questioning everything. If they’re right, then what am I? A short, strange-looking outcast with no real friends, no respect, no chance at love? A walking target for betrayal? I know I shouldn’t be so damned pessimistic, but you have to understand—when you’ve spent enough nights talking yourself out of the dark, you start to wonder if there’s any light left at all.

I do it all myself. Every time I fall, I pull myself up. There’s no hand to reach for me, no arms to wrap around me and say, “It’s okay, you’re not alone.” No reassurance, no comfort, just me and my own reflection in the mirror, trying to convince myself that I’m enough. And I swear, some days, it’s the hardest battle I ever fight.

This world is not fair to me. But I know—I know—I’m not the only one. There are others, just like me, stumbling through the same storm, looking for shelter in a world that would rather throw stones. And I keep thinking, the answer to all this misery—it has to be love, doesn’t it? Love is the most powerful thing a man can give, and yet, we hoard it like gold and spend our time throwing dirt instead. Why? Why do people choose to hate when love is right there, waiting to be given?

I don’t have the power to change them. Not today, not tomorrow, maybe not ever. But damn it, it hurts to be overlooked. To be unseen, unheard. I tell myself I don’t need their validation, but the truth? The truth is, every man needs a little kindness, a little encouragement, a little proof that he matters. And yet, they won’t stop for me. They won’t acknowledge me. They won’t admit that maybe, just maybe, I’ve got something good inside of me.

And maybe—just maybe—they’ll finally admit it when I’m gone. But tell me, what’s the use then? What’s the good in being loved when you’re no longer there to feel it? Couldn’t you—just for once—do it now? While I’m still here, dying for a little kindness?",2,2025-01-30 16:02:45,1,1.0,Anra517951

offmychest,1idtzgh,I'm Sick Of Telling My Friend To Leave Her Partner,"If there's a better place for me to post this please let me know. I'm also open to advice.

I've known my friend over a decade. We've been extremely close over the years - like sisters at times.

I fucking hate her partner. I have hated him for at least the last 7 or 8 years. In my opinion he is an irredeemable person who has been abusive to her in every way possible. Yes I have seen evidence. No I am not here to detail the abuse.

I am here to say that every few months for the past couple years she has told me she wants to leave him. I always try to be the most supportive and give any advice she asks for. She goes back to him and drops the subject. I know the statistics - I know that usually it takes over half a dozen attempts before an abused partner can fully leave. We are well past that.

Everyone in this woman's life knows he is bad for her. My problem is that we have gotten to the point where friends have literally told her they would support her and her child completely financially if she would just leave. When the conversation gets a little too serious about leaving she goes, ""Hmmm I don't know"" and flakes. She's been to therapy. There have been interventions. Nothing changes.

I feel like a bad friend but I'm sick of this. I'm angry at her that she doesn't want better for herself or for her kid. They aren't married and he doesn't have legal claim to the property they live on. She vents and vents and vents about him but never takes any action to change the situation. I feel worn down after years of this, but I also feel like I'm a bad person if I stop talking to her or try to establish boundaries around this subject.

I told a new friend the story in detail recently and they told me to block her. I feel guilty that it sounded like a tempting solution.

offmychest,1idnvfn,First time I had a break down and anxiety attack,"So I thought I knew anxiety before, I thought I had, had bad break downs before but ho ho was I wrong!!! 

This whole incident still haunts me and I hate when it comes to my mind.

Small context, Grandma's a narcissist and loves snooping through people stuff and throwing things out or cutting them up.

Main context! We had a boatload of family come to visit during September I believe. This was all something that we were informed of last minute by my grandmother and there was a lot going on. We had my four cousins along with my aunt and uncle coming to visit. We only have three bedrooms in the house so we had to figure this out somehow. The solution we reached was my uncle would bunk with Grandma, my older cousin would take my bedroom, and my aunt and three cousins would stay downstairs in a bedroom we made in the basement. We had two weeks to convert the room in the back of the basement to a proper bedroom and fix the bathroom down there.

I was on scrapping and painting duty for days so I was already pretty exhausted and stressed. I had just finished the day before painting the bedroom downstairs and was just decorating the house for Halloween early. When all of a sudden I hear my mom's bedroom door open, which was not good at all as it was just me at home with Grandma. So I went inside under the pretext I needed to use the bathroom and low and behold I find grandmother snooping through my mom linens closet where she keeps bedsheets and etc. Grandma did not like that I found her snooping. Eventually she grabs this old orange bedsheets of my mom and declares she going to cut it up and toss it out cause it's old. I told her that's mom's though- she didn't care obviously. She was taking it downstairs when luckily my uncle called so she left the bedsheets on the dining room table and left to get the phone. Seeing this open window I quickly grabbed the blanket, hid it in my bedroom where she couldn't reach it and locked My moms door before going back outside to finish what I had been doing.

When grandma got off the call and saw I took the bedsheet, she LOST it. Started screaming and yelling at me from inside the house, (I was outside), she stormed back upstairs and tried to open my mom's room to find it locked- she was furious!! I was on a call with my bf at this time cause I scared and holding on by a thread. I could hear her the whole time yelling, screaming furiously and banging on the bedroom door trying to open it. Pretty sure she took a big kitchen knife to try and get the door unlocked.

She sounded fucking insane, mom left her phone at home, I couldn't call her for help. Eventually I just couldn't handle it anymore, I grabbed my phone after bf went to eat dinner and ran over to the neighbors house where I finally just broke down crying for a good hour or so. I stayed at the neighbors till eventually mom got home. And even then I was absolutely terrified to go home. Apparently grandma panicked when she saw I was gone and made up a lie that she heard me on the phone with my bf talking about running away. 


That was the first day of my nerves just feeling like a nuke waiting to go off at any second. 
My first bad anxiety attack happened when the family was here. I was in the kitchen having breakfast with my mom and cousin, everything was fine, the conversation was fine, nothing was wrong, yet I kept feeling this weird sensation in my body, just tense and like something waiting to blow. I didn't know what it was exactly but I just knew I needed to leave the kitchen. So I did just that, I made up a lie that I was going to take a shower, the moment I got to my mom's room though something inside me just snapped and I started crying and slowly that turned into hyperventilating. Which was the state my mom found me in and I just couldn't calm down for the life of me or explain why I was like that. I just remember the overwhelming fear of Grandma finding out about it and using it against me or telling the visiting family about it. That and the fact I was supposed to be helping my aunt that day with decorating for a party so that was running through my head as well. I just wasn't having a good time all around, even when Mom managed to calm me down I feel awful the whole day- the whole week. Everyday that week I felt like I'd explode at any second, it was the most awful feeling of my life and I still get it every now and then but luckily it's not as bad as it was during the time of prep for family visit and during family visit.

offmychest,1idsvx6,Rant: I got an annoying loser friend and he pisses me off more and more,"Disclaimer: I understand calling my friend a loser is a poor choice of word and may seem like a slur and that I hate him. It's not true. I called him loser because if his situation which I describe below: Lives with his mom, doesn't work, lives off the government.   
  
For context, my friend has dealt with anxiety for \~15 years and maybe more. It sucks and I was supportive of him. Now he's much better. Such as before he couldn't go out, couldn't work etc. because of maybe random anxiety episodes. Today (I say today when I feel it's been at least 5 years) it's been much better, as in he consistently can do activity, go out, talk to people, ""kinda work"", etc. He finally got his first legit job at a convenience store last Monday, January 30th.

He finally got a job and I was genuinely happy for him. He hasn't worked for 15+ years and he lives off his government money, living off it month by month. I feel he can finally experience a ""normal"" life, being able to work, make money, buy off stuff he wants, making his own money, not living month by month, maybe live in an apartment etc. (he lives with his mom). But after merely a week he's been complaining so much that it's really annoying me hard and crushed my hope of him. I just can't stand him anymore.

He bargained for 25 hours when he got hired. He has a list of stuff to do and can leave after. His job should take 5 hours per day hence the 25 hours. The first day he did 10 hours, which is insane I agree, hoping it'd get better. It did, he went off from 10 hours to 7 hours in just 2 days after which is good improvement. I kept encouraging him saying for sure the first days are the hardest. He'll get used to it and hopefully can reach his goal of doing all the work in 5 hours. It's also can be normal that the job takes a bit longer since he's just starting.

This Monday already, January 27th, he says it's too hard and he's working too much and that he plans of finding a new job. At first it triggered me, I said I can't believe he's already complaining after a week. But I try really hard to understand his situation. With time I understood it's just not what he wanted. He wanted a stable 25 hours job and of course it's hard for him with his current situation.

Tuesday, I went with him to a concert for 2 days, so he had 2 days off. The first day talking with him, I told him he's just starting and suggested to him that if it's not improving to at least ask his bosses if he could have either a day off or they give him less tasks to do. He said it was a good idea and said the job would be much better if it was possible. The next day, he's talking to me about programming course (which seemed completely out of the blue) so I ask him if he was planning on taking some. He said ""Yeah, to be honest, my job is a reality-check. If I keep working at this job for months I'll do a depression or I'll legit go in a burnout""...

I bluntly told him ""dude, you've only been working for 1 week. At least check if it goes better after like a month or two..."". Honestly this pissed me off. There are so many things I find wrong. He his already thinking he's gonna go in burnout after a week not even working full time. He says this after I encourage him, tell him it should get better once he gets used to the job and after suggesting he talks to his boss about it. Keep in mind he was on his day off with me to the concert in between so he didn't even worked a bad day that could've changed his mind. Also he's talking about the programming job as if it's gonna be easier for some reason. Like how TF would you know about it seriously. Also, all I think about is all the poor souls who has to work 40 hours jobs that maybe they don't like but don't have a choice. Does he think about those people? After that he even talks about how some jobs are only 10 hours and pays really good and how it would be the best jobs in his situation. BTW the example he gave me was like doing activity with kids... like good example dude as if it's easier dealing with kids than working at a convenience store. And I was seriously like ""does he really think he could find a 10 hour/week job that pays very good money easily?""

Anyway, now I realize just the worst guy he can confide to about it. I work 40 hours for 8 years already, I already tried supporting him. I give him suggestion and tell him it might get better but what seems like the next day he just complains again. Whenever he says wow it's hard I worked 35 hours I'm kinda like, that's life, it's rough and it happens, and I don't think he gets it. I wonder if he understands that in the real world, people work to get money and that working is not easy. I'm also can't believe how in one hand he's complaining about working at a convenience store but then is thinking programming is gonna be easier or any other job in that matter. I'm not saying working at a convenience store is easy either but it makes me think he completely disconnected and doesn't understand the simple basic fact that working is just hard and can suck and that's why we get paid. I think he's looking for the ""perfect"" easy job and it just pisses me off honestly considering he hasn't worked for 15 years and he talks as if he has an idea of which job he can or can't do. Does he understand that he can't just live off government money as if it's owed to him? Not to guilt trip him, I'm for helping financially anybody who needs it. But man it's been 15 years and he's been better for at least 5 years. Even before getting a job he was giving reasons of why it wouldn't work even though he never even tried the job in the first place. ""I can't work in a movie theater cause if they put me as cashier and if a client starts being angry I'll be too stressed and wouldn't know what to do"" is just an example.

After ranting, I'm thinking of being honest with him if it doesn't improve. I'll say look I already told you ""this this and that"" and if it doesn't help I can't help you anymore. Please confide in someone else and stop talking to me about your job problem.",1,2025-01-30 18:52:41,15,0.67,SwimmerInformal9290

Okay I'm really bad at explaining this so I'm just gonna start with an example of something that happened literally today.

So I'm playing this game I love for the like 10th time. This time I wanted it to be a bit more difficult so I'm using items that are intentionally weaker than what the game usually wants me to have. So specifically thought to myself ""I'm not going to use this item for my characters cuz it makes the game too easy""

After like a few hours of playing I'm looking through again to see what my characters are holding again and I see they are holding the items I told myself I won't use. And I don't remember equipping that item onto the character

Does that make sense?? There's gaps in my memory

I'm so upset and defeated honestly, I just went through hell and came out the other side last year. Now this thing pops up

If I tell my mom she'll be like ""why do you always want something to be wrong with you"" if I tell my therapist she'll be good with it but if she needs me to give any test or anything special my mom will have to find out

offmychest,1idqphu,Just taking a dump.,"A mental dump. I graduated back in 2023 as an IT, 3 years of my college was during the pandemic and i became lazy in studying, so I didn't really learn much. 

I got a job after being absorbed from my OJT as a Graphic Designer/Artist, creating projects for a company and ALL of their branches with little pay, around 12k php or $200+ a month, and lasted a year. Not sure if I was dumb or just scared of not knowing how to start my career in IT with little to no knowledge. I loved my job, but yeah, the pay sucks. 

Now, I'm currently working as customer service representative for a shitty healthcare company. Pay is fairly decent (at least, where I am from), BUT I find talking with strangers expecting me to do what they want or to know everything on how to solve their problems drains me. I'm just waiting for my contract to end this March then I'm hoping to find a better job this February. 

It's all weighing down on me, especially I have a sister that keeps on pressuring me, saying that my degree is just a waste if I don't find a better job. I really don't know what to do or what my plan is. I just wanna lay here but I also want to do something about it... ",1,2025-01-30 17:22:08,0,1.0,No-Set2615
offmychest,1idqh6o,Breastfeeding & Relationship,"So here FTM (F28) my husband (M34) hates me because I stopped breastfeeding our DAUGTHER at 2months and a half. 

She is now 5 months, thriving healthy and happy. He keeps on nagging about it. And it seems like he cannot forgive me. Everyday he’s saying that I screwed her up, and that I’m useless and not a good person for that. Also we have some other issues, that he cannot forget like my friend from childhood she does some drugs with her friends. And he’s mad that I talked to a crackhead, Also he tells me that I’ll end up like my mom, she broke up with my father after 25 years because X reasons and  found another man & he keeps nagging and saying you will end up like her and he talks bad about her all the time. Basically, he just makes me feel guilty and bad about everything. Even tho I’m the one taking care of our DAUGTHER 24/7, and he barely helps. I’m going through a lot and I don’t feel like he’s supporting me neither I don’t feel the love coming from him. 

I’m in a big dilemma, I’m thinking about leaving since I feel like I’m not happy in the relationship anymore. We been together for almost 2 years now.

offmychest,1idqgmo,Terrified and at my wit’s end (TW),"Suddenly remembered this after years of not worrying about it. At uni when I (25F) was 19 I’d slept with one of my friends (I’ll call him M) a couple of times but we’d agreed to not take things further as we didn’t really have chemistry when talking or too much in common. 

After we’d agreed this though, we would flirt at parties etc and one night we ended up kissing in someone’s bedroom. I asked if he wanted to come back to mine and he said yes. We stayed at the party another 45 mins ish and I did notice M was drunk, slurring his words slightly but I was a bit drunk too and didn’t think much of it. 

We left the party with J, a mutual friend who lived in M’s accommodation. They were having some minor argument and when we got to the turning for my halls of residence M and J continued walking/having their conversation. I remember stopping for a moment and thinking “oh, that’s a bit awkward, does M not remember we’d agreed to go back to mine?”. Having analysed this over and over again now I also recall thinking maybe he’d forgotten because he was drunk. 

I kept walking with J and M back to their flat. J went upstairs leaving me and M in the living room on our own. We started kissing again and M asked if I wanted to go to his room. I asked what was happening with J and said “she seemed kind of upset” and M said “oh really is she?” and ran off upstairs to talk to her. Looking back, this might’ve been another red flag that he was drunk as he hadn’t fully understood how J was feeling. 

M came back downstairs and we kissed some more and started to take things further. After a couple of minutes of having *ex he said “I feel a bit too drunk, can we stop?”. Obviously I said yes and we did.  

I’m really concerned by the fact I decided to go back to M’s flat after noticing he might’ve forgotten our agreement. It was a sign he was drunk and I shouldn’t have perused it. I feel like a r*pist and I don’t know how to live with myself. Please please help me :(((( 

I also asked him recently if he ever felt uncomfortable with me or remembered anything weird around this event and he said no everything was fine… but I’m worried my own behaviour was wrong. ",1,2025-01-30 17:11:49,7,1.0,DesignerMinute4841
offmychest,1icshc6,"My partner is in massive debt, and I don’t want to take financial responsibility for her and her kids","My partner has a huge amount of debt, and she just told me about it—almost two years into our relationship. I feel torn. I love her and want to support her, but at the same time, I don’t want to be the one paying for the debt she accumulated due to poor financial decisions.

I had an honest conversation with her and told her that financial irresponsibility is an absolute dealbreaker for me. If I had known from the start that she couldn’t support herself and her kids, I probably wouldn’t have pursued the relationship. On top of that, I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t be with me if I weren’t financially stable.

This also explains some previous conflicts. I make almost three times more than her, and in the past, she expected me to include her kids in things like vacations, dinners, and outings—which also meant I had to pay for everyone. We fought a lot about it, and I never understood why she pushed for it so much. Now I get it—she was already in massive debt and just couldn’t afford anything herself.

Recently, I made it very clear that I don’t want to go on any trips or big outings until she takes care of her debt and is actually able to pay for her and her kids. To be clear, I have no issue covering a bigger share when we do something together since I earn more, but I don’t want to be forced into planning things for all of us and then be expected to pay for everything.

One big dilemma I have now—her debt means we can’t travel together. Does it sound fair if I travel alone? I don’t want to be held back by her financial situation, and I’ve worked really hard to be where I am today.

Would I be an asshole for traveling on my own and setting these boundaries?",167,2025-01-29 13:18:22,99,0.94,Pretty-Wing-9957

offmychest,1idpozv,I'm tired of everything,"  

I don’t know where else to vent, so here it goes. I’m struggling. Financially, emotionally—just in general. I don’t make a lot of money, but I’m doing my best to keep things together. My mom can’t work, my dad just decided to stop paying child support for my 15-year-old brother, and now we have no idea how we’re going to cover everything.  

And then there’s my other brother. He’s 26, still living at home, and refuses to contribute anything. He doesn’t want to help with bills, groceries, or anything else, because in his mind, we’re just trying to “take his money.” But at the same time, he refuses to move out. He just sits there, completely unbothered, while we stress every single day about how we’re going to afford rent, food, and basic necessities.  

I’m so exhausted. It feels like I’m the only one actually trying to make things work, while he gets to live here for free, acting like it’s not his problem. But it IS his problem. We’re a family, and we’re drowning, and he just doesn’t care.  

I don’t even know what to do anymore. I don’t want to fight, but I can’t keep watching my mom break down over money while he sits in his room, pretending none of this affects him. It’s not fair.",1,2025-01-30 16:38:24,0,1.0,Pixiestookmybrain
offmychest,1idpii3,I can't stand my 12 year old niece.,"Let me first say I don't have kids of my own, but I like kids. My best friends daughter (14) feels like a niece to me and I absolutely love her, and can't imagine a life without her. The difficult pre-teen years always drive me nuts, but as a whole I don't have anything wrong with kids. I work at a school and I LOVE my job!

But I struggle so much with my niece. Technically my niece-in-law, but my niece regardless. She has always struggled with her mood.  She can be happy one minute and when the smallest thing makes her mad she is pouting and makes it hard for anyone to have fun then.  She has always been very immature for her age.  Now at 12 I think she acts like an 8 year old with the attitude of a 14 year old.  She still jumps on the bed for Christ sake! It's not that she drives me nuts now after she got to this difficult age, because I know hormones are going crazy inside her so this is normal and I try to rationalize her behaviors but ever since she was a little kid she has drove me nuts.   

For context, my parents were very loving and supportive. They raised me that I can do anything I want, but I can't quit anything. If it's a sport I need to finish out the season, I don't have to do it again the next year.  That turned into if I have a job and I'm not happy I cannot quit until I have another job lined up. I was basically never allowed to miss school unless I was really sick. So now today, even though I may not feel like going to work or whatever that day, I can't just call off or not go if people are counting on me.  I really believe if I had kids that's how I would raise them. 

My niece is an only child, with a very nice well rounded family, and spoiled as hell! Gets everything she needs, wants, and more.  Her parents try to discipline her but from how I was brought up they are way too easy and lenient.  If she is tired, she can skip school, few years ago she had some issues at school so they took her out completely to home school. I won't even start where I think she needs the social interactions and feel she will suffer because of it.  She does sports and if she isn't happy with it she is allowed to quit mid season.  She has been in music and if there is a performance coming up she doesn't feel she is doing well her parents will ask if she wants to back out.  

She cannot entertain herself at all. She relies on others to entertain her. My husband is the fun uncle, and she seems to hang out with us because of that.  If we are playing a game, she will cheat to make things in her favor and when we shut it down because it's not right of her, she pouts. She will do this stupid crap like sneaking up behind him and putting mustard in his hair because she thinks that's funny, and pout when he get's angry with her.  She has also become very snarky, very cocky and arrogant, and just an unpleasant person all around.

Husband is annoyed with her too but is like ""she is just a kid, and needs good people around her and rooting for her in this period of life."" Yes, I agree, but it's so difficult for me.  I hate it. I really love the family!  But because of her, I want nothing to do with them. I don't want to go visit them, go on vacations with them, or anything.  We still do see them fairly often but I really don't want to.  She makes me so annoyed when I'm around and I'm trying so hard to hide my disgust in her behavior that I can't even be myself. We don't feel we are in a place where we can say much about it. 

It's sad because she actually has a lot of common interests as I do. I feel like I could be a great aunt and genuinely enjoy being around her if she didn't make me want to pull my hair out. I'm genuinely scared she will give her parents so many issues as a teen because she seams like she will not be easy. 

My husband wants to have kids one day, and I always was open to it, now I'm not sure now because of her. I know parenting and how you raise them is a big factor, but I fear having a kid like that. Then I am around my best friends kid and some kids at school and I'm like I could do it. It's an inner struggle. 

Anyway, I just had to get this off my chest. And I think I feel a bit better now.  I am hoping she grows and matures a little into someone I like. High school kids are my favorite! But right now... it's just frustrating. ",1,2025-01-30 16:30:18,1,1.0,Which_Courage_6651

offmychest,1idov9v,I Reached Out To An Old Friend,"I (27F) had a friend in high school, Jenna (27F), who I was inseparable with. We met in homeroom in grade 9 and we became friends. Back then, I was a coward. I get anxious whenever I had to speak publicly, kept to myself most of the time, and didn't have many friends. Jenna was the opposite, which is what made us click. We balanced each other out.

After graduation in 2015, we grew apart slowly, as people do. I know it's just life, but this is why I am posting.

Jenna is getting married to her high school sweetheart after dating him for almost 11 years. She bought her dress in the town I currently live in. I sent her this message:

""Hey, so I didn't wanna say anything on the shop you got your dress at, but if it's at the boutique in [My town], I actually live down the road. I was wondering if you come back to town before your wedding (About time, I've called it since day 1), if you want to catch up if I'm not working?""

I sent it. I am now sick, about to throw up. I gained confidence and became more social in the past ten years, especially three years ago after I began boxing for fitness. However, the OP from 10 years ago seems to be coming out. No response from Jenna yet, but I am hoping she declines. I'm not ready to face Jenna, not after all these years.

Update 1: I got a reply in the early afternoon yesterday. We're meeting up when she goes to pick up her dress. I can hardly contain my excitement. If 17 year old me knew this moment was going to happen, she would definitely be heart broken Jenna and I grew apart, but pleased to hear we are reuniting.

offmychest,1id4u21,Life is so unfair to the purest people.,"My cousin has always been subject to some sort of medical issues since birth. He has suffered a lot personally but everytime I went back to my ancestral home, he would be waiting for us in the verandah with the widest smile and the most welcoming demeanor. He never let his problems get in the way of making another person happy. He always remembered important dates and events for the people closest to him and made sure they knew that he was by his side to support as much as he can. He is easily the purest soul I've had the fortune of meeting. An innocent child in the body of a 29 year old. He had no borders and treated everyone with the same amount of respect. He had no stigma towards any sections of society. He was the definition of what a human should be - and all that with chronic health issues from his brain to his feet. 

Last week while crossing the road with one of our trusted family friends, a bike crashed into them and they were both critically injured. My cousin landed head first leading to severe internal bleeding in his brain and our family friend was the one who took the impact of the crash so his condition was beyond my understanding. I saw the CCTV footage of this incident and along with my brother and another cousin (both of whom are lawyers) I am able to confirm that it was the riders fault as he was going on the wrong side of the road at an alarming speed. They were looking towards the left side not expecting a bike to come speeding in the opposite direction. 

He has been on ventilator for a week now and the doctors have said there is almost no hope in reviving him. Our family friend has already passed away and I couldn't even pay my respects to the man who put himself in harms way to protect my family. The guy on the bike was a labourer of sorts from another state who had another female (we don't know who) sitting behind him on the bike. We are pursuing legal angles as well but we've lost already and there is no jail time that can bring back the cornerstone of our family.

I don't understand why life was so unfair to them. I don't believe in ""God's Plan"" or "" the karma of our ancestors' sins"". I will never believe that my cousin has done anything to deserve even a fraction of such suffering because that's how innocent he was. And for such a pure soul, whoever writes our fate decided that he has spent enough time on earth amidst his family who loved him to bits. 

I've been thinking for so long about this but I can't find a single answer that justifies my grief. His mother and elder brother are absolutely broken and disoriented. They do not deserve this either. Even though he is elder to me, he had always been a companion and treated me as an equal. He never pulled rank on me and listened with attention whenever I, or anyone spoke. He was always curious and has stunned me with his thought process quite a few times.

Every single day, I see people who hurt, manipulate, cheat and take advantage of others - but they are all happy in life and enjoying it to the fullest. While my cousin was alone, living in a tiny world of his own. I do not understand this imbalance in life. If an all knowing entity such as God existed, they would never allow such things to happen unless their morals were compromised too. I'm not a saint and I would gladly take his place in the ICU without a second thought. But I can't do that. 

To everyone reading this, please hope for his immediate recovery. We have less than a day left and I can't stop thinking about how my aunt will have to let her son go just like that. 

AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHILE DRIVING ON THE ROAD. YOUR HURRY OR IMPATIENCE IS NOT WORTH ANOTHER PERSONS LIFE. I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF YOU ARE LATE - BUT YOU CANNOT RISK ANOTHER LIFE JUST TO SATISFY YOUR FALSE SENSE OF PUNCTUALITY. TWO INNOCENT LIVES WERE LOST BECAUSE ONE GUY WAS IN AN UNNECESSARY HURRY.

I've had very little faith in humanity for a long time but now I've completely lost it. I will never believe that everything works out in the end. Because it clearly didn't for them. Their life of respect, affection and concern ended in pain, grief and loss. There is no way that can be justified. It's unfair.

I hate life and I hate everyone who has gotten away with their sins.

I'm just tired of all of it l'm sick of being anxious she'll never change. Selfishly enough I hate dealing with her and I honestly think I will be able to relax when she goes and she hasn't even turned 50 yet. Am I wrong for these feelings?",1,2025-01-30 15:34:43,0,0.99,GrievanceGoblin
offmychest,1idoact,A sweet moment recently that made me tear up,"26F, on/off grieving a break up that happened in the last week of November.

Recently went over to a friend's house to give her some late christmas gifts. I needed to be with friends since i was feeling really depressed lately. She was related to the woman i dated but was fine with me coming over.

Felt ironic it was a rainy day. Bought some more food and went to her place.

Alice (not her real name) opened the door, we greeted and hugged. It was her lunch break.

She also had a breakup happen with her fairly recently. The house was strangely silent, since the last time i had been there she was fostering some kittens and their mama. (October of last year)

We talk about how we're feeling. She tells me she doesn't have much food in the house but she can make me something. I tell her i'm okay, i got a monster energy drink for lunch since i'm not that hungry.

She's a bit upset by this. ""How do you expect to get better if you don't take care of your body? Do you want to get better?""

I say: ""I'm not sure."" Because i've been having some suicidal thoughts lately and i don't know if i rather get better or not be here anymore.

She asks me what i usually eat and gets up. I didn't ask her for anything but she tells me she's gonna make me something, i have to eat.

I refrain from making any dark jokes and comments of the sort.

She went to the kitchen to make me a toast and a latte, with the things she has in her house.

While waiting i feel guilty. She didn't have to do that just for me.

The silence sets in and i remember the last time i was at her house. I had been with my girlfriend at the time, and even though i felt she was distant, we had the cats to distract us. The silence was too much.

She brings the toast over and i'm holding back tears.

I take one bite of it and they can't be contained, i'm full on crying on her living room while she's finishing my latte.

She comes over with the latte, sees me and hugs me. I eat and we talk about it.

It had been so long since someone did that for me, my body couldn't handle all the love. She gave me big sister vibes and having already a big sister and how she cares for me, it's too much and too sweet.

My relationship was mostly long distance, and it was my longest one. For a few months i had felt my girlfriend (currently ex) distanced from me, even when we were together irl. She was always sweet and helped me a lot in my life for the almost 2 years we were together. I can only hope i helped her too.

I like doing things for other people, even sometimes to my detriment. People pleaser habits die hard i guess. The fact that ""It had been so long since someone did that for me"" comes with more than the above explanation.

I'm living with family, my parent and cat. My parent had gotten accepted in uni, so on top of having a full time job, they had university online at night.

I had no job. So it was only logical that i be the one to take care of the house, do all the cleaning, tidying up and cooking. It's fucking exhausting. Couple that with no reason to live and ADHD, and its not a great mix.

At the start it was fine doing that, even tho exhausting both mentally and physically. I was doing so much and ending up in arguments with my parent, which didn't help the mental health already in decline. I've wanted to off myself for a few months now. But that thought is also on and off.

I'm looking for a job since September... It's not easy. But at least that was a sweet moment i had recently, since all my other friends are busy with their jobs and social lives. I'll be okay, eventually.

Thanks for existing <3",1,2025-01-30 15:34:08,0,1.0,random_online_ghost
offmychest,1idoa1n,"I feel like more I try to be as good as my friends, the greater the distance I am from them.","My friend is off to cambridge, while I'm studying at Bath for uni, my other friend landed a placement paying a ludicrous amount as a yearly salary, while I'm unemployed and looking for summer internships. All of my friends have large social circles, but I'm confined to a small one, with friends that think they're closer to me than I am to them. I'm struggling with my degree, while others are thriving in their degree and achieving greatness. 

It just feels like I'm always the incompetent one in the friend group from high school, when everyone is so much better than me. I feel conflicted when I hear another friend announce their good news to me. One side of me is genuinely happy for them, and I feel like they deserve this opportunity and they'll do great! The other side of me just feels sour, knowing that they'll always be better than me, and that I'll never be able to stand on equal footing with my friends. I feel inferior to them, and sometimes it makes me feel very jealous. I feel like it's about time that I succeed and tell good news to my friends, but I'm unable to think of any ""monumental"" achievements that are worth being congratulated for. It feels horrible being the ""worst"" one in the friend group when everyone else is thriving. 

Whenever I work hard on something, and try to achieve their level of greatness and prestige, it just never works out for me. I struggle with concepts in my degree, and my battles with my mental health takes a large toll on my overall performance. It feels bad when as a extrovert, my social anxiety leads to me being an introvert as I sometimes view myself as not worthy of speaking to people. I genuinely love talking to people, but I feel like my social anxiety stops me from talking to new people in fear of judgement, and that I need to precisely fine tune every single word to avoid misunderstanding and backlash. 

It just feels like I'm not cool / good enough to be with my friends. With everyone showing their best image on social media, and conversations about how I'm doing end with - I'm doing fine, wbu? - feels draining. They say that comparison is the thief of joy, but I derive joy from comparison. It gives me some reassurance that I'm doing good, or at least not bad. 

Whenever they share their good news, and random things, I can't get myself to bring up this topic as I don't want to rain on their parade. I genuinely want them to be as overjoyed about the news as possible, but the thought of me being inferior to them grows larger and larger. 

It feels awkward when you know that comparison is pointless, but when you compare the achievements of others to you, they mean the world and have large magnitudes. When you compare your achievements to others they are meaningless. Who cares that I worked 3 months in my summer, which took up the entire summer holiday and gained valuable experience, when a friend of mine is set on a career path that will allow them to prosper and live a good life. Who cares if I made a new friend, when they have a large friend group?

offmychest,1idnlht,I think I regret having an abortion.,"This is a throwaway account because I want my identity concealed. I am a very private person, and I have a hard time talking about intimate matters. So I know here.I can get stuff off of my chest without.It being known who I am and feeling that there are no strings attached .I am a bit emotional, so I am sorry that I am all over the place. I might put a little bit of humorous things in here because it is the only way. I'm coping right now because I am really going through it.

To start off this month, I had an abortion through the pill. Originally, I didn't even want to tell him about the pregnancy since we were not together anymore, but after some convincing, I did. I really didn't want to go through this, but I wanted to respect the other PERSON'S needs and for their own sake. Take in mind that I have a  relationship with God, so I'm religious. I'm a very traditional woman at this point of my life, but the word says that we, as humans, are given the freedom of choice. For me, this wasn't  some easy decision. The way that a lot of people like to proclaim. It is the last thing you want to do. 

 I never thought I  would ever be going through something like this.. I trusted the person with my body enough to think that we were being safe. To be a little comical, obviously, as you can tell from this post, we were not. Need a moment to laugh because i'm having a really hard time. I had been celibate for 4+ years, so I felt even more stupid when I found out i was pregnant. Anyways i got my sparkle back after not dating since 2019. You can imagine after being celibate for so long and what  passionate kissing will do. My self-control and discipline were put to bed as soon as he said it was natural to feel this way. This man checked off all the boxes completely different, man. I was absolutely smitten, and so was my body, apparently.


As someome who's been a survivor of rape as a child and being abused before or dating a sex addict, I've had a harder time being able to relax during sex without a shot or two to get me through. I have autism so being touched on top of that has not been the easiest.I've never had sex that felt intimate or felt comfortable having sex without a shot before. For the first time with someone being intimate didn't feel like an obligation or something I had to do because that's what a good girlfriend is supposed to do. I actually enjoyed sex for the first time because it felt intimate. Giving my body to someone is a lot for me to do, I do not regret having sex with him at all. It didn't feel like just sex or fucking it felt intimate. I waited to cuddle,be affectionate, or anything until we became official. This goes on to something as simple as holding hands or laying your head on the others chest. I don't regret dating or being intimate with him.  I approach trusting  someone with my body to a different level, for reasons above stated. 

Anyways, we break up some time after for a good reason, not on bad terms.I found that I'm pregnant weeks later because my period hadn't come at all. I haven't had it irregular periods.I'm a twenty six year old woman. I've had my periods since I was 12. The last time it was  irregular was when I first started it. My period tends to last about three days , which means i'm ovulating a lot longer. I grew up in a really religious house, so period talks, sex talks, and knowing the different cycles of your reproductive clock just wasn't a thing for me to know. All I've known. Is that you're bleeding, or when you're in your 40s to 50s, you hit menopause. This is my first time experiencing anything like this. I've educated myself pretty well, understanding the different phases now 


I think my period is late because of the stress of the breakup, but i've never had stress delayed periods before. My body just felt different.Everything felt different, and as a woman,  you  know your own body pretty well. So, I took a pregnancy test. I took about like 2 of them, and they were positive, and obviously, I was going to be in denial, so then i bought HCG tests, and still they were positive. But i was in shock because I was like, no way, like there's no way because we were safe. Obviously, the method we were using wasn't the most safe. My  2 relationships before always were very extreme and safe. I was also on birth control. But I wasn't expecting a relationship or to be intimate in this time frame.

  This person didn't think birth control was good for you. And neither did I because I've had a side effect where it changed my hair.You can clown on me for this, but I trusted this man, and I was dumb for that. I was dumb I took accountability for that, too. I should've said something, but my judgment was clouded because of the sex.. I go to get a blood test and what do you know. i find out I'm pregnant, so there was no denying this anymore. 


Anyways I tell him I'm pregnant, and at first, he thinks I'm clowning on him or something. I wasn't so during the pregnancy it was affecting him badly like you would've thought he was the pregnant one, not me. The news of this seemed to destroy him, and he just would ask if I was keeping it, and it seemed persistent that we should go the other route. It broke my heart seeing how badly it affected him. Anytime I maybe thought about it what I wanted, it seemed like he would slide in with what he thought, and that's what we should do. I felt like I never had the time to sit back and think about what I wanted in all honesty because of how he was and how badly it was affecting him. I felt like my decision was being rushed completely. 

He would continually ask when I was calling and that we should get it done soon.I respected how responsible and supportive he was. The day it happened, he spent most of the night with me until i started bleeding and he had work the next day. I am thankful for that, at least. He would check up on me and ask how I was doing. But I never felt the choice was mine to begin with. It's been a week now since it's happened, I've had some of the most unplesant dreams. I've been left in discomfort emotionally and physically. It's left me feeling less and broken as a woman. I cry every night, I'm frustrated, and I have so much shame. I am going through this part alone, I feel so easily agitated by anything and everything almost unfortunately. I feel I've lost myself, and I'm having a hard time looking in the mirror at myself. Seeing the sac and what came out of me has been haunting me. I can barely sleep or eat, and it's been hard on me. I am unsure, but I feel I have a slight resentment hiding  that I'm unsure of. I lowkey wish I could go back and actually think about what I wanted for a week without someone in my ear influencing my decision. 


Sometimes, I wonder what would've happened if I didn't tell him. I don't mean to sound selfish, but I'm hurting. I'm mad and this is something I'm going to have to live with. This person doesn't have to deal with the after affects or anything, so it's all off of their plate. Not once did I feel that this person would put themselves in my shoes. I at times would be irritated because I felt they were rushing me or not giving a time of day without thinking about themself. I am mourning this little what-if baby truly, I'm grieving alone, and I feel upset and hurt. It made me question who I am. The only thing that seems to bring peace is when I'm with God, but this wound is so deep. I wake up every morning with a bed tear soaked. I can't pretend and just move on like nothing happened, so suddenly like he can, I've accepted that. I know there is a time and season to mourn and be sad. I've always been a hopeful person and very optimistic, I just feel a little lost at the moment. I feel like my first opportunity of being a mother I tarnished, I feel. I feel a little less as a woman 

 For others who have gone through this, what were your first steps in the right direction of healing? I do hope to hear of mens perspectives if they have been in a similar situation.I've dealt with a lot of things in life that I've moved on with, but this is so much different than anything else I've dealt with. I know there is a time for mourning, but how did you manage? I know we handle pain differently, but I've seem to be depressed and my pain is dulling out my usual coping methods. I can't even hit the gym because I'm physically still a bit sore due to it being recent. What's going on in the world has definitely been a sight for sore eyes, so I've had to tune it out. Especially with the whole pro-life segment and topics on abortion atm. The only positive out of this is a lesson learned, I'd say. Trying to see the positive in the midst of ugly is what gets me through.

I am not asking for sympathy. I just want to rant for the first time and last about this. I am going to seek a therapist as well, I have an appointment lined up. I will more than likely get back on my zoloft, visterol, and trazadone for the time being shortly. 

I've had to update this.

offmychest,1id44nr,My coworker kissed me,"He’s married with 2 kids. I’d be in to him if he wasn’t MARRIED. I feel incredibly guilty that when he kissed me I had mixed feelings. We were drunk and I kissed him back at first. Then I pulled away and said “I don’t want to disrespect your marriage.” He kissed me again and I broke away to say “I don’t want to disrespect your WIFE.” He kept kissing me, and my dumb ass kissed him back. I guess I was drunkenly hopeful that him continuing beyond those warnings meant he wanted to choose me.

When we were sober and away from work the next day I asked him “what was that? you have a wife, so what did that mean?” He said “I’m a fool” and got super awkward. I asked him if he’d explain how he felt, and he just shut down and tried to brush it off with some humor. I know his aversion to conflict and serious conversations is somewhat cultural, but the conversation mattered to me. I told him “If you won’t tell me how you feel, I’m going to assume the worst.” He said “no comment.” He texted me later that he knew there was nothing he could say to be fair to me because he does in fact have a wife. I told him I appreciated him being honest now instead of later, but that I was hurt because I felt like he played with my heart. He said it wasn’t his intention, and he hoped I wouldn’t be mad at him.

Everything at work is fucking weird now. I don’t know how to find a place of normalcy. He brought me Starbucks the day after our text conversation which felt like a peace offering. When we were alone he asked me how I was doing and I told him, “not my best day.” He gave me a buddy-hug where he patted me on the back. It feels so weird to go from his tongue being THAT far in my mouth, to getting a buddy hug.

I feel so gross. I feel objectified and I feel shut down at work, even when he’s not around. I feel guilty for enjoying the kiss and wishing he’d gone about it the right way so we could continue. I feel guilty for my mind wandering at times to accepting side chick status just so I can keep making out with him. I feel guilty all of this is on my mind instead of my work and what’s actually heathy for me. That’s want I needed to get off my chest.

Edit: Thank you for the feedback. I am not here for sympathy. I posted this because I’m actively processing this situation alone and imperfectly in real time on a ship at sea, and it’s confusing as fuck. But for everyone shifting the blame to me— hide your husbands if you’d like but they’re the ones responsible for keeping their vows. I made none.",27,2025-01-29 21:45:31,96,0.66,hard_day_sorbet
offmychest,1idngov,I am a 17 year old prostitute,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me but it scares me, it’s like i go through cycles where i have clarity and i feel dirty and awful and then i feel invincible again and like i just need money and this work isn’t effecting me emotionally.  I guess it’s important to know that I have a long history of childhood sexual abuse as does my best friend.  

so about a week ago my best friend came over and she said she had a “client coming to give her money” and i said ok he can come and then she said she was gonna have sex with this random guy she met on discord for $150 and that he’d pay me $50 to watch.  I don’t know why I said yes.  I don’t know why I let the guy come over.  they had sex but he was staring at me on the corner of my bed and he kept asking if i was enjoying it and if i could strip… and I did.  and he started touching me and fingering me and i didn’t like it so i froze and just stared intently at my chess game on my phone and tried to disappear.  eventually i kicked the both of them out and just got as high as I could.  since then, i’ve agreed to do it again because i’m already dirty and i need money so i can get drugs and forget about all of this.  I need advice. I can’t tell my therapist for another month because that’s when i turn 18 (i’m in a program where i have therapy three times a week, my parents have therapy and then a group and i don’t feel comfortable saying anything that might get me in trouble until they legally can’t tell my parents) I can’t tell anyone in my life because i have a wonderful boyfriend who doesn’t deserve this (and obviously i don’t deserve him).

offmychest,1idnfp5,I don't deserve peace,"So I bit the bullet and buckled down about my mental health, fought through the whole stigma we face through peers and family. I'd like to share some things, things I've already talked to my therapist about. He thinks it'd be a decent idea to get a little of my story out there and possibly help me fellow veterans and anyone else in a similar chair.


It appears my childhood wasn't all that great like I thought it was, I wasn't abused or sexually assaulted and I had and still have a good relationship with both my parents. I grew up poor, on a farm in a pagan (heathen leaning) household. I loved working the fields and learning as much as I could from everyone around me. I made sure to work hard, push limits and be sure to absorb as much as I could. I was always held to a higher standard from my parents, pushed to do well in school and was given plenty of love and support. I was put into martial arts at a young age, once my pops started working a lot and my mom got a promotion at her work so it was more of a babysitting type thing. BJJ was newish to America at this time, definitely wasn't as big as it has gotten, but I fell in absolute love with the art and apparently this new found love started my inner me to be really mean to, me. 

I pushed so hard, broke limits and trained my ass off. I was pretty decent at picking up the things taught to me, but all those times I was tapped out, or couldn't land a submission or failed at a sweep or transition, I was way to hard on myself. Wayyyyy to hard on myself. I didn't know it was toxic to be like that, I just really didn't like the feeling that I had failed. This made me sick, the feeling of failure. So I really dedicated my free time to honing and perfecting my body and mind to not fail. But the failures kept coming. I was consumed with hatred for myself, though I was way ahead of my peers. Fast-forward to high-school... I tell ya, kids are mean to someone who is different. I was definitely bullied and not shown acceptance or gentleness from those assholes. Until I met my HS sweetheart. She didn't care that I lived on a farm, or that I believed in a different religion than everyone else. She showed me tenderness and care, love and support, I truly loved her. She was many of my firsts, first kiss, first date, first dance and first sexual partner, a truly wonderful person She was. We were together for the better part of 8 years, rarely had an argument and definitely had the most transparent relationship with her. She brought some peace to me, and it felt amazing...

Senior year comes around, I graduate early to join the Military, it's the height of the conflict of GWOT and I really wanted to serve my country in the highest way possible, in my mind. She stayed loyal, faithful and supportive throughout boot camp and the training after, I leaned on her with full trust She was the one. My first deployment, went how you'd think a deployment would go for a young and impressionable 18 year old, experiencing the culture shock of a foreign land, learning how to live minimally wasn't to hard for me though. The brotherhood and friendships formed before the deployment were deep rooted, of course all my fellow Marines were my brothers, but there were a few who I'd consider better brothers than my own, true and raw friends. I was at ease with my evil inner self... until we lost one.. A stellar Marine and even better person, one who took me under his wing and was sure to teach me all that he knew, bled out at my knees even though we did absolutely everything in our power to keep death from taking him.. I failed.... I failed horribly. It's hard for one to fathom the hatred and disappointment and disgust I felt in myself..

I'll stop there for now, I'll keep it going in shorts like this. Feels good to get it out there..",1,2025-01-30 14:53:17,1,1.0,Diablohurts51
offmychest,1id7kee,Is this grooming or what? And I REALLY need advice on what to do,"So to start off, my biological dad had left before I was born and idk anything about him. Many years ago my mum remarried anothet guy when I was still a child, and her life's been good so far I think. Btw, I'm a girl and teen rn, won't say which age exactly. However, these few days he's been giving pervert/pedophile vibes, really. We chat on snapchat and like a few weeks ago he'd be like ""I want you to sit on my lap like this GIF 😅"" and even once he kinda got that to happen and I was so uncomfortable. He keeps bringing up topics like sex and romance but tried like justifying that ""sex"" talk by explaining some stuff to me like hormones and how it's normal after I told him I don't want to do that in the future nor get married or have kids.

Around 40 mins ago we were chatting on snapchat again about a similar topic that lead to him saying these exact things: ""I like your body 😘"",""If you were my wife I would have licked your breast like a baby 😘"" and I sent him multiple question marks and then screenshotted that part, but he kept telling me to delete it and finally I did, but little did he know that before I did, I sent that screenshot to a gc with my friends. One told me to tell my mum, the other also said a similar suggestion but other stuff, but wtv. 

I don't want this to escalate into something more, and he's just making me uncomfortable overall. Like whenever we play chess together, he forces me to like let him caress my arms and legs, yes even up to my thighs and sometimes touches near my private part there but not exactly, I think maybe by accident but I told him that I don't enjoy what he does so I think he'll stop. I love playing chess but him doing these actions makes it like hell and he calls those ""massages."" 

Idk what to do. I feel like if I tell my mum they might fight a lot or even divorce and my mum relies on him financially like she doesn't work and her family back home is poor. 

Also that happened at like 2:14 am, and rn it's almost 3 am as I'm writing this after finishing that conversation and talking with my friends. My mum is sleeping and I don't want to wake her up rn so I'll wait until the morning or maybe even a few days and then tell her idk I might not even. (Btw we're in vacation and it's normal for us to stay up late.)

Note: My mum and I are Muslim reverts and he is a born-muslim, however no blame is upon this religion but rather upon him, and no discrimination to it pls. 

Any advice or suggestions will be appreciated, thanks for reading.

I live an offbeat minimal life in the mountains. I'm not very used to the idea of dating through apps. And this is the first time I tried to do so. Invited somebody home, since he wanted to do something really random and I was like okay but idk I felt I was constantly judged for the life I live. 

But despite that, I felt it went fine and we spoke for the next day too. And then there's nothing. Absolutely nothing from the guy. 

Does this happen often?

I mean I thought the world had changed a lil and men atleast would tell you if they're not interested. But ghosting out, isn't that a lil amateur? I think I'm overthinking lol. 

But yeah, been an experience anyways. But idk if I'll do it again 🥹

Just getting it off my mind as the past few days have been pretty uneasy trying to think all the possible reasons why someone wouldn't respond.

offmychest,1idmvuz,My life is going to be ruined by someone I thought was a friend for a good while.,"Ever since I was a kid, I’ve spent my whole life online, and I’ve done awful things and met awful people. But recently, I said something horrible—of all places, on my college’s MS Teams. It could have been gone if my classmates agreed to delete it, and most of them did, but there’s one person who refuses to let it go.

Before the message was deleted, this guy took a photo of it with his phone (not a screenshot) and has been spreading it everywhere for the past month. It stopped for a while, but now he’s made things even worse. He went onto the web version of MS Teams, used developer tools to forge a new, identical version of my message, but this time removed the blur from his original photo to make it seem clearer and more readable.

The worst part? This guy is the last person who should be acting morally superior, tutting at me and saying ""actions have consequences GOSH actions have consequences"" as He’s been heard screaming racial slurs and saying even worse things about fucking minors and shit, but no one cares when he does it because that’s just “expected” from him. Meanwhile, I made one mistake, and and he’s been dragging it on for over a month, making sure everyone sees it.

He acts completely deranged and loony all day, everywhere we go, to all kinds of random people. He spends all day yelling random things, acting like a complete caricature of a man, berating me for not being ""locked in"" on my work every time I look away from the screen or talk to my friend, then turning around and meowing into Reuben’s ear for 15 minutes straight.

I have a huge job opportunity coming up with a giant company where I’ll be coding, and I’m terrified that he’s going to ruin it by spreading this forged-but-real message. He has it out for me, and I don’t know what to do.

Any advice? Has anyone been in a situation like this? Sorry to post it here but idek where else to put it. Please please help me",0,2025-01-30 14:25:31,17,0.33,Crucified_Saussages

I hate fucking overthinking every damn thing i ever say to anyone-

Like all i wanted to do was chat with my friend for a bit. Realised im stupid. I sent some stuff but they never responded so idk what happened to them so my stupid fucking brain takes that as they hate me and don’t wanna talk

And so = me overthinking more sending sappy messages i have to edit 5000 times until its right and still isnt right and atp idk if they have seen it or not.

I hate when i fucking do this bc i told myself i wasnt going to do this. And my friend has better friends than me anyways that idk why they still want to talk to me anyways since their other friends r so much cooler than me.

I can’t even make online friends- and im just a weird kid anyways and bad at communicating.

And ik they have stuff going on and my dumbass still writes out whole ass paragraphs me ranting abt something stupid with my family (thats a diff story for another day)

And im already fucking anxious and depressed and i just want to talk to people to get the feelings to go away and have a distraction but i just can’t communicate and i suck with words and hate it. I don’t know why people are my friends nor why they put up with me- like im fucking stupid and this is why i cant do anything good with my life like my sister (also another story for another day)

Safe to say i hate myself- alot.

How do i stop this shit- im tired of constantly feeling like i fuck everything up with everything i ever say in my life- i cant communicate so i might as well just not talk anymore unless its like mandatory (like for acting or sum)

Im tired of talking, and telling people random things that pop in my head. It would be better if i was quiet anyways…

Im tired of it being this way and i don’t know the solution ",4,2025-01-30 06:50:33,5,1.0,PurplePANdaL09
offmychest,1idmsk8,Totally lost after almost losing my dad and actually losing my partner,"Today has been tough on me (29M)

The day started with a text from my step mother that my father had a heart attack this morning. He's had a ton of close calls recently with his heart and it's always a lot to handle. I'm currently living on the other side of the country from my family and it's be hell not being able to be there during times like this. It eats away at me that each time he is in the hospital it may be the last time I speak to him. It breaks me bit by bit. 

Later in the day, my partner came over and we had a discussion on our relationship after some talks from the previous day. They expressed to me that they think they are lesbian and that we should split up. It felt like a bomb just dropped out of nowhere. This was my best friend since I've moved out here and losing them is tearing me apart. For some context, we have been together roughly 9 months - so while it wasn't long it was the easiest and most natural relationship I've ever had in my life. We spent ever weekend together. We shared laughs, cries, our interests, and our dreams. Not even three days ago we were looking at apartments to move in together. I was so excited. I'm not upset with her wanting to find herself and be fulfilled but the space she leaves with me is destroying me currently. I know time heals all wounds but as someone who has had many toxic relationships I thought I had found my rock. 

Don't wanna ramble on too much but needed a place to throw these emotions out there. My dad survived and is in recovery. I'm patiently waiting for more news tomorrow. My ex has sent some messages to help clarify their feelings since our in person talk was alot of just heartbreak on both ends. I just don't have the stomach to read more of it. I've just laid in bed since about 4pm (it's 5am now) and even when I try to sleep all I do is feel sick and cry so damn much.

Thanks for listening. I'm gonna try to stay strong, I just feel so empty and lost right now.",1,2025-01-30 14:20:37,0,1.0,Mbourland1995

offmychest,1idmqbr,My boyfriends cousin is obsessed with me,"I (23,F) been with my boyfriend (25,M) for 2 years. He is the most wonderful and kind person i know, and i love him very very deeply.

Before me and him dated, i was talking to his cousin every now and then. We had mutual friends and knew eachother briefly and he would message me and flirt with me. As i recently came out of a very abusive relationship before that, i enjoyed the attention. We talked more sexual rather than a traditional ""getting to know eachother"" type of texting. Few weeks after that i found out he had a girlfriend this whole time. I'm ashamed but i did still talk to him a few times after that. I knew it was wrong but i was just in a very bad mental state that year. We never hooked up or even met up. He would reply to my stories every now and then but we stopped talking like we used to (Everything happened in a month or so)

Fast forward a few months and i was dating his cousin. I've never met a nicer man and i couldn't believe good men like that existed. I did hook up with a common friend of us, and i told him that beforehand but i never told him i talked to his cousin. It felt weird letting him know his cousin was kinda cheating on his girlfriend... Also i found out that said cousin was texting alot of girls including some of my girlfriends.

I didn't know that we would be serious so quick and that i would fall in love with my boyfriend after being depressed so long. I was finally in a healthy relationship. I told his cousin about us and he gave us his blessings. I asked him if i should tell my boyfriend and he was like no no need, it would cause him a lot of stress too and there was nothing to tell, as we never hooked up or met up even. So i felt like why cause drama and just leave it.

Now the problem is, he doesn't fully leave me alone. He would still text me now and then telling me he thinks about me and misses me. He sent me links to hotels, asked me if i wanted to go on dates and how horny i make him. I never reached out to him but i was always anxious when he messaged me. He reminded me of my narcissistic ex and i kinda got ptsd and didnt know how to talk to him and handle all this. I'm scared if im not on his good side he'll expose me and paint me as the bad guy or threaten me as that was something my ex always did. I've tried everything: play along, be nice, cuss him out, ignore him. He won't leave it. They are a very close cousin group and im close with them too and i just feel so weird when he's there. I even bailed out on vacation so i dont have to sleep in the same house as him. But i can't always avoid him.

I hate not being thruthful to my boyfriend. It eats me up and i feel like i'm way too deep in to go back. I would ruin the whole dynamic, my relationship and the cousins relationship too. I'm scared everyday that it'll come out. I really can't imagine losing my boyfriend and i wish i could just love him purely. I feel so so guilty.

I never meant it to get this far and i feel trapped by him cause he knows no matter what he says to me i can't tell anyone.",0,2025-01-30 14:17:18,1,0.5,Severe_Hunt_2691

So, drunk off mind numbing tiredness i thought instead of blasting music or ignoring them like i used to, but i know thats not right, so in a ironic effort really to be a 'better' person, i put on one of my favorite songs in my headphones on blast and sang or danced to it as long as i could until the 'anger' lessened into a quiet relief.

offmychest,1idmgo9,Been lying to everyone for the past 2 years,"I feel really awful about it. Its been eating me from the inside since before this I wouldnt even tell a small lie to anyone.

Im not going to go into specifics but the past 2 years have been very difficult for me. I attend to university in a different city and live in a dorm. For the last 2 years, I've been holed up in that room. 

Completely disconnecting myself from social places, my lessons and even sometimes not doing self care for weeks end. Im not doing fine, I dont attend my lessons. Im nowhere close to getting my degree. But I've lied about it. Idk why I chose to do that. The longer I kept that lie the heavier it became. Harder to tell anyone, even to my family. Actually especially to them.

And it kills me to know if I have gone to them for help at the start, they wouldve helped me. Maybe have me see a therapist, or freeze my student license so I wouldnt waste years and thousands the way I did now.

The more this goes on, the more Im disappointed in myself. I cant even look myself in the mirror anymore. Since when did I become this lying mess? I dont even know whats wrong with me. I cant get myself to seek help. Its such an easy thing, but stepping outside of that dorm room feels like the hardest thing to do in this world.

I dont know where to begin, where to go, what to do for a change. I've been stuck in this mess that I dont know how I got myself into.

Thats why I decided to write here, atleast to tell someone. Or vent about it. I dont want sympathy, I dont deserve it anyway. I've disappointed everyone I know with what I've been doing for the past 3 years. Sure, they dont know about the situation Im in. But if they did know, they would be.

Then my dad came out from the toilet and out of nowhere touched my chest. And I seriously have no idea whether or not it was a mistake or intentional? Like my dad tapped on my left boob 3 or 4 times while smiling looking at my chest? Idk how to describe how my dad smiled at me. He just looked drunk even though he wasn’t that drunk. My sister couldn’t see what my dad was doing since I stood behind my mom and my mom couldn’t either. But they did ask me what my dad was doing to me but for some reason I literally just frozed in the moment when it happened. I didn’t know to address it. It was fucking weird and I feel so uncomfortable now. I have no idea what made my dad think it be okay to touch my breast??? Maybe my dad thought I was my mum since he was drunk. I’m not trying to make any excuses or defend my dad because regardless if he was drunk or not doesn’t  change the fact he touched me like that.. But now I regret that I didn’t say anything because it did made me really uncomfortable but I don’t know how to bring it up. But at the same time I don’t want to make a big deal out of it if my dad really didn’t had any idea what he was doing in that moment. I barely speak with my dad on a daily basis so I don’t know how to confront him about it or if I should tell my sister or mom.

Me(29F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for 9 years. My first real relationship, living together etc.

We had a lot of ups and down during these 9years. There's too much to write it here, but basically I moved to his country to be with him, atm I am financially dependent on him(which I feel bad about) He has been verbally/physical abusive to me some times during these years. He has anger issues. But with time everything always settles down, and everything ""is fine again"".  I do care a lot about him, but I am aware our relationship often is unhealthy. I thought about breaking up many times, but I just can't do it. If i do, I will also need to leave the country. Which I'm not happy about. 

And the thought of loosing him makes me insane:( He have helped me with many things, but still it's hard to forget the bad things that happened.. for quite a while now, our sexual relationship has also become nothing, and it's very hard to talk with him about more ""hard/emotional"" things..
Now, the bad thing, probably the only real bad thing I did in our relationship..
I've had this online friend for 5 years, a guy. I became closer with him over time(online) and have also met him irl. Not sure what exactly I feel for him, sometimes I felt some romantic feelings, which is bad since I have a boyfriend. Other times I'm not sure. I know he likes me in a romantic way.
I visited him again(which is stupid) and my boyfriend doesn't like it(understandable) and I promised nothing will happen between me and this friend. But I have been longing for more romantic feelings, feeling loved and appreciated. I feel my boyfriend in some way doesn't care much about me, but also he does. I'm so confused..
So, last night, I was at my friends place (in abother country) And in the evening he came to my room. We were kinda ""flirting?"" over text, but I really didn't want to do anything with him. And he knows I'm in a relationship. 
But he suddenly started to kiss me, and I didn't say stop. I didn't even like it. But I didn't say stop. And at the same time I'm longing for this romantic? feelings from my boyfriend. So after he kissed me, we kept laying in the bed together for a long time(with clothes on, but very close together) and while it's happening I kept thinking ""shit, this should never have happened, it's not okay!!'':( I'm flying back tomorrow and I'm sooo anxious, I feel SO guilty! Should I tell my partner what I did? Then I'm sure he will go crazy and break up and I have to leave my home with him..which I understand. But I also think he did bad things to me, not cheating, but being abusive. And I always forgave it. I never did anything wrong to him until now. I feel so bad about it.. I dont know what the hell to do. It feels terrible to keep such a secret. I don't want to make him sad, obviously he will be. I'm so stupid.

offmychest,1idl56t,I Had a Breakdown and Was Hospitalized. Here’s My Story.,"
Hey everyone, I want to share something very personal because I believe it might help others going through something similar.

The Beginning: Burnout and Work Pressure

I’ve always been someone who worked hard, but over time, the pressure kept increasing. On top of the heavy workload, I also experienced workplace harassment, which severely affected my mental health. To make things worse, I started taking sibutramine ( a drug where I live used to get the thinner ) due to concerns about my weight and appearance, without realizing the impact it would have on my mind.

The Breakdown

All of this built up until, on October 25, 2024, I had a psychotic episode. My mind simply broke. I don’t remember everything, but I know I needed urgent hospitalization. I spent some time in the hospital until I stabilized. It was a confusing and difficult period, but necessary.

Post-Hospitalization and Recovery

After being discharged, I continued treatment with psychiatric follow-ups and therapy. Accepting everything that happened was tough, but little by little, I started to regain stability. Adjustments in medication, changes in routine, and my mother’s support were fundamental.

Where I Am Now

Right now, I’m focused on my recovery. I’ve been walking daily, adjusting my schedule to improve my well-being. I’m also relearning how to socialize and stimulate my speech, as the breakdown affected my communication.

There are still challenges, but I’m learning to handle them, one day at a time.

ok so before i tell what happened just want to say that im okay and that it doesn’t affect me that much as of right now.

I live in australia and also are a teenager so to get around we use trains and so my friends and I go to the city to have fun and after we are done and go back down to the train station since there are multiple train platforms at this station we have to go down another level, but as we go down the first escalator one of the trains were passing and slowing down at the station until a guy kinda runs and jumps down the tracks. I remember the train stopping halfway of the platform as the guy I assumed is crushed and luckily I did not hear him being crushed as the horn from the train was really loud. I turned my head and went down the next escalator when it hit me, also my friends were in front of me and couldnt see any of it. For me it made me feel sick for about 5 minutes but now im fine but cant stop thinking about it.

Tbh im thinking about what the train driver was feeling as well as the man as he looked about in his 40’s bald, sunglasses and tattoos.

edit: happened about 3-4 hours ago as of writing this, also i am 16 if anyone need to know

He actually spoke with me, and I see now that I've been stuck. In and endless war of getting reventon everyone who's ever hurt me. I've made it my identity to please others, that I've never really known myself. That in fact I'm terrified of myself. This hatred has been eating me alive and I've known it. I've done everything to get what I want, to get to the top and to hurt the ones that hurt me. But it's not even what I want. I hate it. It gives me nothing, all it does is make me angrier. All the people that have hurt me have changed me. I don't want this anymore. I'm so sick of fighting, I don't want this. But I don't know how to stop. What would my life be without this?

offmychest,1idklz5,"Statistically, there aren’t 30.000 undocumented immigrants that commit violent crimes in the US in one year","There are around 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. According to Cato Institute analyses (2018, Alex Nowrasteh), 0.04% of undocumented immigrants end up convicted of violent crimes each year. 

This analysis is from state level data (Texas) which of course isn’t representative of the entire US population but Texas has one of the largest populations of undocumented immigrants alongside California so the sample size is considerably large.

Which means the percentage of 0.04% shouldn’t be too far from the population mean, especially considering numerous other studies that conclude low crime rates for immigrants in the US. 

Some examples of the “numerous studies”:
- The Integration of Immigrants into American Society by National Academies of Science (2015)
- The Criminalization of Immigration in the United States by the American Immigration Council (2015) 
- Does undocumented immigration increase violent crime? By Light, M.T, & Miller, T (2018)
- An examination of first and second generation immigrant offending trajectories by Bersani, B.E. (2014) 


So statistically, assuming some deviation from the population mean, around 0.03% - 0.06% of undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes.

Which makes between 3300 to 6600 people a year.

offmychest,1idd9q3,i am disgusted with myself for the mistakes i’ve made,"I made mistakes and now I am destroyed with guilt and disgust for myself

Growing up I consumed a lot of porn and it definitely was not healthy and many issues arose because of this. On twitter there were threads about hot people on tik tok and this was around the time tik tok became popular so I became used to masturbating to these threads that were on twitter porn accounts. When I was on Tik Too my fyp also had some videos similar to this and it reinforced what I did on twitter. There was one day where I masturbated to a video that came into my fyp that was sexually suggestive and after I scrolled to the account and found out that they were 15 and this was when I was 19. I felt so ashamed and disgusted with myself and I developed OCD around being a pedo. After this point I told myself no more tik tok. After this there was a time around 20-21 where I was masturbating to a video on a gay porn twitter account but the video was pornography. After I pressed the hidden reply and someone said that this might have been a minor and i felt that same shame and disgust. I’ve then since been trying to fully cut out porn from my life but i’ve developed immense guilt and ocd around being a pedophile and it’s eating away at me and i’ve become suicidal. I went through sexual trauma as a child and this has triggered me and i feel so much pain and guilt. I just want to get this off my chest. ",4,2025-01-30 04:32:51,0,0.75,None

offmychest,1idgmm5,When I was 8 years old I caught my mom cheating on my dad,"On a winter day I was sat in the backseat of my parents car with my dad in the drivers and my mum in the front passenger seat as we were parked waiting for some type of appointment because we got there early. Seeing as I was pretty bored I asked my mom if I could play some games on her phone. I was a bit of a curious kid and snooped around sometimes and it occurred to me then that it would be a great time to go through some of my moms texts. 

I ended up seeing this random number that had some message along the lines of “I miss you so much baby” previewed and thought it to be a bit weird as she didn’t have this person saved as an actual contact or name unlike every other conversation she had in her messages. Curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on the text conversation because I wanted to figure out who it was, a decision I ultimately regret over a decade later. I scrolled for much longer than I should have, seeing some really vulgar and explicit things including pornographic images, none of which were at all appropriate for an 8 year old to be viewing. 

At one point when I was either 10 or 11 I mustered up enough courage to confront my mom about it and she vehemently denied it right to my face even though I had known it to be true for a fact, even sort of gaslighting me in a way as if I was crazy for bringing something like that up. My parents divorced a year or two later and I never spoke a word of it to my dad. I think she also tried to get me to meet the man she had an affair with at one point while we were on vacation in another state and she told me he was coming over but he never showed, which she seemed pretty hurt about ",2,2025-01-30 07:27:29,2,1.0,Charming_Space7225

offmychest,1idjuw2,Relationship dillema,"First off, I know this is a small issue compared to what others may be going through, but I really need to get it off my chest and ask for some advice.

Before I start, here’s a bit of background about my relationship:  
I'm a 24 (M) currently living with my partner (25 F). We've been together for almost a year now (our anniversary is this February) and have been living together for about seven months.

The reason I started dating her was out of guilt. Back in college, I felt like I used her for sexual relief, and I decided to take responsibility by pursuing a relationship with her. I know she loves me deeply, and because of that, I often feel guilty whenever I think about breaking up with her.

Now, here’s my dilemma:  
I want to break up with her, but she currently depends on our shared accommodation. The cost of living where I stay is extremely high—renting even a one-bedroom apartment would take up the average person’s entire salary.

I still care about her as a person and a friend, but I don’t love her as a partner anymore. The hardest part is that she loves me wholeheartedly, and I don’t want to hurt someone who has been nothing but good to me.

For the past few months, I’ve been trying to figure out a way to end things as gently as possible. The plan I came up with was to lie about being required to serve in the military back in Korea. It would have worked out well since she originally planned to quit her job around April and move back home to be with her family. I figured I could keep up the act for a while longer and eventually break up with her by saying I couldn’t handle a long-distance relationship.

So, I told her that I’d be leaving for military service this April.

But my plan completely fell apart when she told me she was no longer going back home and had decided to stay here instead.

Why does this ruin everything? Because I don’t actually plan on joining the military—I intend to continue working at my current job. If she stays in the same area, there’s a high chance we’ll run into each other, and the lie will unravel.

To make things even more complicated, my entire family has been against this relationship from the start. They believe there’s a huge gap between our lifestyles and worldviews, and they think I’m ""too good for her"" both financially and physically. While I don’t completely agree with them, I understand where they’re coming from—we come from different cultures and had very different upbringings.

I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1,2025-01-30 11:12:13,1,1.0,Tough-Equipment-105
offmychest,1idjt33,My mother’s loss,"I keep trying to find ways to understand the deep hurt my mom is going through. I’m not sure why; maybe I’m a sucker for punishment. 

I’m mostly met with bereaved parents to young children, or parents that lost their adult children to suicide, addiction, murder. All terrible circumstances, of course. 

For some reason, my brother’s death is made worse to me, that my mom has no good reason for losing her son. He’s just gone. 

My heart aches constantly. Not in the way that you say as a turn of phrase. Not in the way that’s exaggerated. There is a deep ache in my chest that I feel deep in to my soul. 
If ever I thought souls didn’t exist: I know that they do now because I feel it every single day in the worst realization.

I personally think that whether we see porn as a normal thing or not we should delete it sooner or later because watching leads to addiction , addiction leads to desperation and desperation leads to contemplating actions. Some might blame mental issues but I blame porn for a lot of things such as 1-fertility of certain nations 2- most of the rape happening today 3-facial and physical imperfections..if you’re that desperate for a quick wank you won’t be so hesitant pulling your wank on little Billy or Amy and get yourself an SA report and jail.

He's trans, and I'm terrified of the possibility of our future being ripped from us in this new political climate.

And on top of that, he has medical worries recently pop up. We are looking into it, but it's -somewhat- concerning, because he has a very strong family history of cancers. His mom was just diagnosed with it, for the third time, last week. His grandfather died of it about 4 months prior. 

I am trying very very hard to not let it get to me. He's not even 30 yet. He's a healthy guy. We live in a blue state. It'll be okay.

offmychest,1idjeik,Coming to terms with who I am,"I've been off my meds, I'm stressed to the brim and I know that there are people out there that care about me. 

I need to let out my creative energy, and I need to try opening up and trusting other people. Being around someone who is going through something similar but in their own way is I suppose something I need to distract myself from the fact that I'm just.. growing older. 

I've tried this for almost 10 years and I feel like I haven't given myself the headspace the really learn all the necessary life skills I need in order to succeed. 

I know there are options, and at this very moment I know I just need to forget about it for a second. 

Something good will eventually turn up, I just need to unwind. 

But I can't continue just running my head into the ground every 7-8 months when I'm eventually bored and/or disgusted it with what I spend 40+ hours a week doing on a regular basis, it's sickening and it has been a constant tedious factor in my overall wellbeing. 

And I just want to forget about it for a second, I know I can control my vices to an extent but my vices are a by-product of my living and financial situation.

I have a good place, its not perfect, but its kind nice in its own way. It's cold and loud, the heat isn't the best and the windows don't really seal properly. 

My kitchen is tiny and I feel disoriented anytime I step in, my washroom has no windows so I feel like I've been locked in a cage, but its not anxiety, I just don't know how to explain. 

Growing up it was rare that bathrooms didn't have windows, you know?

It's just been really tough, the constant need for stimulation exacerbates the fact that I will end up turning to whatever vice I have rolling at the time to keep my brain levels going head on. and it has happened, over and over and over again to the point where I just feel like I need to run away and sit in a cave and just be still, but I can't do that - I know myself. 

My medication does have a good amount of affect on me, I stay on time, I keep up to date with friends and loved ones, but then I'll eventually have a point where I get drunk all of a sudden and take a day off and proceed to become a dick. 

I know I'm not a bad or violent person. I just think too much, sometimes a bit too much. 

And thinking often isn't a great thing for me. 

I know I have my flaws, and I know I'm not perfect but I need to do what's best for me and I had been distracted by the fact that my financial and career life was stressed me out beyond belief, and I had stripped myself away from the urge to chase dopamine. 

Truth be told, I was raised this way - maybe its a generational thing but I know that I have hte attention span of an infant and I don't know what to do about it. 

Maybe I've just been running away from my problems, maybe there's something more going on here, maybe there's just nothing wrong but I'm just exhausted with trying to find answers and I know that I will always be biased towards my own actions and behaviours

Medication alone isn't really the answer, medication has given me perspective but I am afraid to take it. 

I need to stop over thinking, and just do - everyone always says this, I don't know how much everyone knows but I know I'm twisted in my own ways and I'm choosing to accept all of my flaws, I need to return the energy back in a different form otherwise I won't be doing anything in my part to help those that are in need. 

My life is in limbo and I'm unsure where I'm going from here but I know that I can pick up the pieces again and give it another shot, but right now what I need to do is stop having my mind race this much.",1,2025-01-30 10:37:13,0,1.0,Vurog

offmychest,1idiywy,I feel like I could never love anyone like I loved you.,"
I am a wimp that deserves to be forever alone.
I couldn’t tell the woman that I loved how I felt about her because of a fear of rejection or not wanting to lose the friendship? How stupid can I be? She asked me directly if I felt the same way she did and instead of opening up to her. I cowered and changed the subject. I had a chance to fall in love with the most compatible person I have known in my 35 years of life. Instead I watched her meet, date, and fall in love with, and marry her current husband. I watched them have two beautiful children together, that she loved dearly. I watched her build a successful career and life. Eventually life created distance.  Years pass and besides the yearly “happy birthday” and empty “we should hangout soon” messages and communication between us lulled. It’s to be expected. She is a married woman and mother of two what did I expect to happen. She is happily married and I had moved on until in day I get a call from her. We spoke and for the first time in years really caught up with each other and our lives. We talked about the past the great times we had together and the present lives we had built. We talked for a while and it felt great to have that connection again. Toward the end of the call she invites me to her home. She tells me to come visit her as she misses me and would love to see me. We live across the country from each other now so a trip would take a bit of planning and while I would love to see her, I found it odd for her to invite a single man to her home to visit with her husband and children. A couple of months go by and she reaches out again. I’m busy with work so I don’t answer, but we send a couple of texts back and forth. She extends another invitation to visit her in her home. I ask her what her husband would think and she replies he doesn’t care. Thinking back on that now that message should have raised a red flag. She didn’t say “he is fine with it” or “I talked to him about it”, but “he doesn’t care”. I ask myself, what kind of a husband wouldn’t care about his wife inviting a single man he only knows in passing to his house? Another month passes and I get a call from an old mutual friend. They tell me to go check out her IG account. Pull up her account and look at her latest post. It’s a picture of and her two children with a caption that reads “Tell my children I loved them with all my heart, tell them what kind of person their mother was, I’m sorry for failing them. I’m sorry for letting you all down.” It was then that I realized she was no longer with us. I thought she was doing so well. I thought she was happy. I thought my presence would be a burden of all she had worked for. I wish I had taken her up on those offers to come visit. I wish I had answered the phone the last time she called. I wish I had told her how I felt about her all those years ago. But most of all, I wish I had more time with her. I love her. I miss her.
